         "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nGoogle is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. Our innovations in web search and advertising have made our web site a top internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. We maintain a large index of web sites and other online content, which we make freely available via our search engine to anyone with an internet connection. Our automated search technology helps people obtain nearly instant access to relevant information from our vast online index.\nWe generate revenue primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising. Businesses use our AdWords program to promote their products and services with targeted advertising. In addition, the third-party web sites that comprise the Google Network use our AdSense program to deliver relevant ads that generate revenue and enhance the user experience.\nWe were incorporated in California in September 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware in August 2003. Our headquarters are located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, and our telephone number is (650) 253-0000.\nOur Mission\nOur mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. We believe that the most effective, and ultimately the most profitable, way to accomplish our mission is to put the needs of our users first. We have found that offering a high-quality user experience leads to increased traffic and strong word-of-mouth promotion. Our dedication to putting users first is reflected in three key commitments:\n•\nWe will do our best to provide the most relevant and useful search results possible, independent of financial incentives. Our search results will be objective, and we do not accept payment for search result ranking or inclusion.\n•\nWe will do our best to provide the most relevant and useful advertising. Advertisements should not be an annoying interruption. If any element on a search result page is influenced by payment to us, we will make it clear to our users.\n•\nWe will never stop working to improve our user experience, our search technology, and other important areas of information organization.\nWe believe that our user focus is the foundation of our success to date. We also believe that this focus is critical for the creation of long-term value. We do not intend to compromise our user focus for short-term economic gain.\nHow We Provide Value to Our Users\nWe serve our users by developing products that quickly and easily find, create, organize, and share information. We place a premium on products that matter to many people and have the potential to improve their lives.\nSome of the key benefits we offer include:\nComprehensiveness and Relevance. Our search technologies sort through a vast and growing amount of information to deliver relevant and useful search results in response to user queries. This is an area of continual development for us. When we started the company in 1998, our web index contained approximately 30 million\ndocuments. We now index billions of web pages and strive to provide the most comprehensive search experience possible. Our team continually improves our relevance algorithms to objectively determine the best answers to our users’ queries and to place these answers at the top of our search results. We are also constantly developing new functionality and enhancing our offerings to allow our users to more quickly and easily find information.\nObjectivity. We believe it is very important that the results users get from Google are produced with only their interests in mind. We do not accept payment for search result ranking or inclusion. We do accept fees for advertising, but the advertising is clearly marked and separated and does not influence how we generate our search results. Inclusion and frequent updating in our index are open to all sites free of charge. We believe it is important for users to have access to the best available information, not just the information that someone pays for them to see.\nGlobal Access. We strive to provide our services to everyone in the world, and the Google interface is available in 112 languages. Through Google News, we offer an automated collection of frequently updated news stories in 30 languages covering sources from almost 60 countries. We also offer automatic translation of content between various languages and provide localized versions of Google in many developing countries.\nEase of Use. We have always believed that the most useful and powerful search technology hides its complexity from users and gives them a simple, intuitive way to get the information they want. We have devoted significant efforts to creating a streamlined and easy-to-use interface based on a clean search box set prominently on a page free of commercial clutter. We introduce new navigational or informational features when we believe they will be most useful to our users, and only after extensive usability testing and experimentation.\nPertinent, Useful Commercial Information. The search for information often involves an interest in commercial information-researching a purchase, comparing products and services, or actively shopping. We help people find commercial information through our search services and advertising products. We also present advertisements that are relevant to the information people seek. Our technology automatically rewards ads that users prefer and removes ads that they do not find helpful.\nMultiple Access Platforms. The mobile phone is the primary way that many people around the world access the internet. We have continued to invest in improving mobile search and have introduced applications that allow users to access search, email, maps, directions, and satellite imagery through their mobile devices.\nImproving the Web. We want to make the web experience as good as possible for users around the world. This includes providing platforms for developers to build, deploy, and run increasingly rich applications. For users, we are investing in areas to improve their experience in using web-based applications, including making browsers more stable and powerful.\nProducts and Services for our Users\nOur product development philosophy involves rapid and continuous innovation, with frequent releases of early-stage products that we then iterate and improve. We often make products available early in their development stages by posting them on Google Labs, at test locations online, or directly on Google.com. If our users find a product useful, we promote it to “beta” status for additional testing. Once we are satisfied that a product is of high quality and utility, we remove the beta label and make it a core Google product. Our main products and services are described below.\nGoogle.com-Search and Personalization\nWe are focused on building products and services on our web sites that benefit our users and let them find relevant information quickly and easily. These products and services include:\nGoogle Web Search. In addition to providing easy access to billions of web pages, we have integrated special features into Google Web Search to help people find exactly what they are looking for on the web. The Google.com search experience also includes items like:\n•\nSearch Options Panel-helps users slice and dice their results across dimensions like time and genre.\n•\nRich Snippets-gives users convenient summary information about their search results at a glance, such as the number of stars in a review, or the scheduled times for events.\n•\nMusic Search-allows users to find and play music by song, album, artist, or lyrics.\n•\nReal-Time Search-blends a live stream of up-to-the-minute content from microblogs and frequently updated sources right on the search results page.\n•\nGoogle Suggest-shows related query suggestions as users type searches in 153 domains and 52 languages.\n•\nSearch Personalization-gives users more relevant results based on their previous signed-on search history or, alternatively, based on anonymous cookies stored on their access device if they are signed-out.\n•\nAdvanced Search Functionality-enables users to construct more complex queries, for example by using Boolean logic or restricting results to languages, countries, or web sites.\n•\nWeb Page Translation-supports 51 languages and automatically translates between any two of these languages, with a total of 2,550 language translation pairs.\n•\nIntegrated Tools-such as a spell checker, a calculator, a dictionary, and currency and measurement converters.\n•\nCached Links-provides snapshots of web pages taken when the pages were indexed, letting users view web pages that are no longer available.\n•\nMovie, Music and Weather Information-enables users to quickly and easily find movie reviews and show times, information about artists, songs and albums, and weather conditions and forecasts.\n•\nNews, Finance, Maps, Image, Video, Book, Blogs and Groups Information-Users are often best served by different types of results. When relevant, we also search display results from other Google products including Google News, Google Finance, Google Maps, Google Images, Google Videos, Google Books, Google Blog Search, Google Product Search, and Google Groups.\nGoogle Images. Google Images is our searchable index of images found across the web. To extend the usefulness of searching for images, we offer additional features, such as searching by image size, format, coloration, and image type, such as photos, clipart, faces, and line drawings.\nGoogle Books. Google Books lets users search the full text of a library-sized collection of books to discover books of interest and to learn where to buy or borrow them. Through this program, publishers can host their content and show their publications in our search results. We also work closely with participating libraries to digitize all or part of their collections to create a full-text searchable online card catalog. Google Books links bring users to pages containing bibliographic information and several sentences of the search term in context, sample book pages, or full text, depending on author and publisher permissions and book copyright status. To date, we have scanned and indexed over 12 million books for search. Last summer we publicly announced our plans to sell our publisher partner’s electronic books, or ebooks, in an open platform direct to consumers and through retail and device partners. We plan to launch this ebook platform in 2010. We are working on obtaining court approval for a settlement agreement reached with the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers over lawsuits in\nthe U.S. over Google Books. If the court approves this settlement, millions more in-copyright books will be accessible to our users. Many books will be available for purchase even if they are out of print, expanding the market for authors and publishers to earn money from their works.\nGoogle Scholar. Google Scholar provides a simple way to do a broad search for relevant scholarly literature including peer-reviewed papers, theses, books, abstracts, and articles. Content in Google Scholar is taken from academic publishers, professional societies, preprint repositories, universities, and other scholarly organizations.\nGoogle Finance. Google Finance provides a simple user interface to navigate and visualize complex financial information in an intuitive manner, including linking together different data sources, such as news events overlayed on stock price.\nGoogle News. Google News gathers information from thousands of news sources worldwide and presents news stories in a searchable format within minutes of their publication on the web. The leading stories are presented as headlines on the user-customizable Google News home page. These headlines are selected for display entirely by a computer algorithm, without regard to political viewpoint or ideology.\nGoogle Videos. Google Videos is our searchable index of videos found across the web. To extend the usefulness of searching for videos, we offer additional features such as searching by video format, quality, length, and more.\nGoogle Blog Search. Google Blog Search enables users to search the blogging universe more effectively and find out users’ opinions on a wide variety of subjects. The Google Blog Search index includes every blog that publishes a site feed. Blogs are web pages usually made up of short, informal, and frequently updated posts that are arranged chronologically.\niGoogle and Personalized Search. iGoogle connects users to the information that is most useful and important to them in an easy-to-use and customizable format. Users add gadgets and themes created by Google and developers to create a powerful and personalized homepage and arrange the content the way they want. iGoogle and Personalized Search also include social features, which gives our users better content and search results based on their social graph as well as what they have searched for in the past, making it easier to quickly find the information that is more relevant to them. Users can also view and manage their history of past searches and the results they have clicked on, and create bookmarks with labels and notes.\nGoogle Product Search. Google Product Search helps users find and compare products from merchants and directs users to where they can buy these products. Users can search for product information that is submitted electronically by sellers or automatically identified by Google software.\nGoogle Merchant Center. Google Merchant Center lets merchants submit product listings that they want to share on Google web sites. Merchants can describe and assign attributes to the information they submit and Google uses this descriptive content to better target search results to what users are looking for.\nGoogle Custom Search. Google Custom Search allows communities of users familiar with particular topics to build customized search engines. These customized search engines allow the communities to help improve the quality of search results by labeling and annotating relevant web pages or by creating specialized, subscribed links for users to get more detailed information about a particular topic.\nGoogle Trends. Google Trends provides users with the ability to track the popularity of keyword searches over time on Google. Users can simply type in any search or compare multiple keyword searches, including people, places, or news events to observe the relative search interest over time from all over the world.\nGoogle Music Search. Google Music Search provides a fast and easy “click-to-play” music discovery service for users searching for music. By entering an artist, album, or song search into Google, users can click the play\nbutton on the search results page to preview the song instantly in the music player provided by our music partners.\nGoogle Webmaster Tools. Google Webmaster Tools enables webmasters to understand their sites’ performance in Google’s search results. Rich data and diagnostics provide insight into top search queries, site performance, and potential problems such as crawl errors and malware. In turn, higher-quality web sites improve Google’s ability to crawl and index the web and provide more relevant results.\nApplications\nInformation created by a single user becomes much more valuable when shared and combined with information from other people or places. Therefore our strategy for products we develop in this space is simple: develop tools for our users to create, share, and communicate any information generated by the user, thus making the information more useful and manageable. Examples of products we have developed with this strategy in mind include:\nGoogle Docs. Google Docs allows our users to create, view, edit, and share documents, spreadsheets, and presentations from anywhere using a browser. Consumers and business users value the ability to use Google server storage and backup as the foundation of this product as it allows them to access their personal and shared content from any internet-connected device and reduces their dependence on a single physical computer or laptop storage system. Collaborative editing, uploading any file type, controlled sharing, data collection using custom forms, and open export of data in a variety of open formats are among the expanded features which differentiate Google Docs.\nGoogle Calendar. Google Calendar is a free online shareable calendar service that allows users to keep track of the important events, appointments, and special occasions in their lives and share this information with anyone they choose.\nGmail. Gmail is Google’s free webmail service that comes with built-in Google search technology to allow searching of emails and over seven gigabytes of storage, allowing users to keep their important messages, files, and pictures. We serve small text ads that are relevant to the messages in Gmail.\nGoogle Groups. Google Groups is a free service that helps groups of people connect to information and people that have interest in them. Users can discuss topics with each other by creating mailing lists and discussion forums.\nGoogle Reader. Google Reader is a free service that lets users subscribe to feeds and receive updates from multiple web sites in a single interface. Google Reader also allows users to share content with others, and functions with many types of media and reading-styles.\norkut. orkut enables users to search and connect to other users through networks of trusted friends. Users can create a profile and a personal mailbox, post photos, and join or manage online communities.\nBlogger. Blogger is a web-based publishing tool that lets people publish to the web instantly using blogs.\nGoogle Sites. Google Sites allows users to easily create, update, and publish content online without technical expertise, with control over who can see and update the site. Google Sites supports a variety of information such as videos, calendars, presentations, spreadsheets, discussions, and texts.\nYouTube.

Today, there are 26 Android devices supported by 60 carriers in 49 countries and 19 languages. We also recently launched the Nexus One, an Android handset sold by Google directly to consumers.\nGoogle Mobile. Google Mobile extends our products and services by providing mobile-specific features, including voice input and location-based technology, to mobile phone users. Specific areas of focus include:\nMobile Search. Our mobile-specific search technologies include:\n•\nSearch by Voice-using their phone’s speaker and microphone, users can speak their queries to Google in English, Mandarin, or Japanese.\n•\nSearch by Sight-using their phone’s digital camera to take pictures, users can search for objects using images instead of words.\n•\nSearch by Location-using their phone’s GPS, users can instantly find the closest and most popular places nearby directly from the Google Mobile homepage-without typing a single character.\nMobile Applications. Google Mobile optimizes the majority of Google’s applications for mobile phones in both browser and downloadable form. Two of our most popular mobile applications include Gmail and Maps.\nMobile Ads. We offer mobile ad products spanning our advertiser and publisher-focused efforts, Google AdWords, and Google AdSense. Specific mobile ad optimizations include:\n•\nSmartphone Targeting-advertisers can now check a single box inside of AdWords to target their advertising campaigns at mobile phones like Android devices and the iPhone.\n•\nAdSense for Mobile Apps-mobile developers and publishers can now integrate targeted advertising directly into their Android or iPhone applications.\nGoogle Checkout\nGoogle Checkout is a service we offer our users, merchants, and advertisers to make online shopping and payments more streamlined and secure.

For merchants, Google Checkout provides a payment mechanism that has industry-leading fraud prevention, and increased conversion and transaction completion rates.\nGoogle Labs\nGoogle Labs is our test bed for our engineers and adventurous Google users. On Google Labs, we post product prototypes and solicit feedback on how the technology could be used or improved. Current Google Labs examples include Fast Flip, a Google News feature that delivers fast overviews of headline pages of top newspapers in rich visual format, and Google Image Swirl, a new experimental feature that organizes images into visually and semantically related groups and presents them in an exploratory interface.\nThe Technology Behind Search and Our User Products and Services\nOur web search technology uses a combination of techniques to determine the importance of a web page independent of a particular search query and to determine the relevance of that page to a particular search query.\nRanking Technology. One element of our technology for ranking web pages is called PageRank. While we developed much of our ranking technology after Google was formed, PageRank was developed at Stanford University with the involvement of our founders and was therefore published as research. PageRank is a query-independent technique for determining the importance of web pages by looking at the link structure of the web. PageRank treats a link from web page A to web page B as a “vote” by page A in favor of page B. The PageRank of a page is the sum of the pages that link to it. The PageRank of a web page also depends on the importance (or PageRank) of the other web pages casting the votes. Votes cast by important web pages with high PageRank weigh more heavily and are more influential in deciding the PageRank of pages on the web.\nText-Matching Techniques. Our technology employs text-matching techniques that compare search queries with the content of web pages to help determine relevance. Our text-based scoring techniques do far more than count the number of times a search term appears on a web page. For example, our technology determines the proximity of individual search terms to each other on a given web page, and prioritizes results that have the search terms near each other. Many other aspects of a page’s content are factored into the equation, as is the content of pages that link to the page in question. By combining query independent measures such as PageRank with our text-matching techniques, we are able to deliver search results that are relevant to what users are trying to find.\nInfrastructure. We provide our products and services using our own software and hardware infrastructure, which provides substantial computing resources at low cost. We currently use a combination of off-the-shelf and custom software running on clusters of commodity computers. Our considerable investment in developing this infrastructure has produced several benefits. This infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data, eases the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services, and automates much of the administration of large-scale clusters of computers. Although most of this infrastructure is not directly visible to our users, we believe it is important for providing a high-quality user experience. It enables significant improvements in the relevance of our search and advertising results by allowing us to apply superior search and retrieval algorithms that are computationally intensive. We believe the infrastructure also shortens our product development cycle and lets us pursue innovation more cost effectively.\nHow We Provide Value to Our Advertisers and Content Owners\nGoogle AdWords\nFor advertisers seeking to market their products and services to consumers and business users over the internet, we offer Google AdWords, an auction-based advertising program that lets advertisers deliver relevant ads targeted to search queries or web content across Google sites and through the web sites of our Google Network, which is the network of third parties that use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads with their search results and content. The Google Network is also increasingly encompassing different forms of media as well, including content providers who use our advertising programs to deliver ads in online video, television and radio broadcasts. AdWords is accessible to advertisers in 41 different interface languages.\nAdvertisers in our AdWords program create text-based or display ads, bid on the keywords that will trigger the display of their ads and set daily spending budgets. AdWords features an automated online signup process that lets advertisers quickly implement ad campaigns on Google properties and the web sites of our Google Network members. Ads are ranked for display in AdWords based on a combination of the maximum cost-per-click pricing set by the advertiser and click-through rates and other factors used to determine the relevance of the ads. This favors the ads that are most relevant to users, improving the experience both for the person looking for information and for the advertiser who is generating relevant ads. The AdWords program offers advertisers the following additional benefits:\nReturn on Investment. Many advertising dollars are spent delivering messages in an untargeted fashion, and payment for these advertisements is not tied to performance. AdWords shows ads only to users seeking information related to what the advertisers are selling, and advertisers choose how much they want to pay when a user clicks on their ad. Because we offer a simple ad format, advertisers can also avoid incurring significant costs associated with creating ads. As a result, even small advertisers find AdWords cost-effective for connecting with potential customers. In addition, advertisers can create many different ads, increasing the likelihood that an ad is suited to a user’s search. Users can find advertisements for what they are seeking, and advertisers can find users who want what they are offering.\nBranding. In addition to our cost-per-click pricing model, we also allow advertisers to pay on a cost-per-impression basis on the Google Network. We also offer Placement Targeting, a service that lets advertisers target specific web sites with text and display ads, so that they can more effectively reach specific sets of customers. In addition to targeting sites by content, advertisers can choose placements on sites based on user demographic attributes. To protect user privacy, we use only third-party opt-in panel data to map the demographics of sites in our networks. Placement Targeting is an auction-based system where placement targeted ads compete with keyword-targeted ads in the same auction.\nAccess to the Google Search and Content Network. We serve AdWords ads on Google properties, our syndicated search partners’ web sites, and the millions of third-party web sites that make up the Google Network. As a result, we can offer extensive search and content inventory on which advertisers can advertise. Apart from keyword-based ads targeted to search queries and Placement Targeting, we also offer advertisers an effective contextual advertising option-Content Targeting-that displays their ads on relevant content pages across our network of partner sites and products. As a result, AdWords advertisers can target users on Google properties and on search and content sites across the web. This gives advertisers increased exposure to users who are likely to be interested in their offerings. The Google Network significantly enhances our ability to attract interested advertisers.\nCampaign Control. Google AdWords gives advertisers hands-on control over most elements of their ad campaigns. Advertisers can specify the relevant search or content topics for each of their ads. Advertisers can also manage expenditures by setting a maximum daily budget and determining how much they are willing to pay whenever a user clicks or views an ad. Other features that make it easy to set up and manage ad campaigns include:\n•\nCampaign Management. Advertisers can target multiple ads to a given keyword and easily track individual ad performance to see which ads are the most effective.\n•\nConversion Tracking. Conversion tracking is a free tool integrated into AdWords reports that measures the conversions of an advertiser’s campaigns, enabling a better understanding of the overall return on investment generated for the advertiser by the AdWords program.\n•\nTraffic Estimator. This tool estimates the number of searches and potential costs related to advertising on a particular keyword or set of keywords.\n•\nQuality-Based Bidding. Advertisers’ keywords are assigned dynamic first page bids based on their Quality Score-the higher the Quality Score, the lower the first page bid. This rewards advertisers with relevant keywords and ads.\n•\nBudgeted Delivery. Advertisers can set daily budgets for their campaigns and control the timing for delivery of their ads.\n•\nAdWords Discounter. This feature gives advertisers the freedom to increase their maximum cost-per-click because it automatically adjusts pricing so that they never pay more than the minimum amount required to exceed the rank of the next ranked ad.\nWe offer larger advertisers additional services that help maximize returns on their internet marketing investments and improve their ability to run large, dynamic campaigns. These include dedicated client service representatives as well as:\n•\nCreative Maximization. Our AdWords specialists help advertisers select relevant keywords and create more effective ads.\n•\nVertical Market Experts. Specialists with experience in particular industries offer guidance on how to target potential customers.\n•\nBulk Posting. We help businesses launch and manage large ad campaigns with hundreds or even thousands of targeted keywords.\n•\nThe AdWords API and Commercial Developer Program. For large advertisers as well as third parties, Google’s free AdWords API service lets developers engineer computer programs that interact directly with the AdWords system. With such applications, advertisers and third parties can more efficiently and creatively manage their large AdWords accounts and campaigns. The AdWords Commercial Developer Program also enables our third-party developer ecosystem to continue designing and delivering innovative business applications based on the AdWords platform and distribution channel.\nGlobal Support. We provide customer service to our advertiser base through our global support organization. AdWords is available on a self-service basis with email and real-time chat support. At certain spending levels and through certain signup channels, phone support is also available. Advertisers with more extensive needs and advertising budgets can request strategic support services, which include an account team, to help them set up and manage their campaigns. Depending on geography, we accept bank and wire transfers, direct debit, and local debit cards carrying the Visa and MasterCard logos. We also accept payment through international credit cards. For selected advertisers, we offer several options for credit terms and monthly invoicing. We accept payments in over 40 currencies.\nGoogle AdSense\nWe are enthusiastic about helping content owners monetize their content, which facilitates the creation of better content to search. If there is better content on the web, users are likely to do more searches, and we expect that will be good for our business and for users. Our Google AdSense program enables web sites that are part of the Google Network to deliver AdWords ads that are relevant to the search results or content on their pages. In addition to AdWords, we also surface non-search AdSense inventory (the Content Network) on the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, allowing certified third party display ad networks to compete with AdWords ads for AdSense inventory. We share most of the revenue generated from ads shown by a Google Network member with that member. The key benefits we offer to Google Network members include:\n•\nAccess to Advertisers. Many small web site companies and content producers do not have the time or resources to develop effective programs for generating revenue from online advertising. Even larger sites, with dedicated sales teams, may find it difficult to generate revenue from pages with specialized content. Google AdSense promotes effective revenue generation by providing Google Network members access to Google’s base of advertisers and their broad collection of ads. Our technology automatically starts delivering ads on a web site as soon as the member joins the Google Network. Because the ads are related to what the web site’s visitors are looking for on the site, AdSense provides the Google Network member with a way to both monetize and enhance their web sites. The Google Network member determines the placement of the ads on its web site, and controls and directs the nature of ad content.\n•\nImproved User Satisfaction. Many web sites are cluttered with intrusive or untargeted advertising that may distract or confuse users and may undermine users’ ability to find the information they want. Some web sites have adopted practices we consider to be abusive, including pop-up ads or ads that take over web pages. We believe these tactics can cause dissatisfaction with internet advertising and reduce use of the internet overall. Our AdSense program extends our commitment to improving the overall web experience by enabling web sites to display AdWords ads in a fashion that we believe users find useful rather than disruptive.\n•\nSyndicated Search. We provide our search technology to partners of all sizes, allowing Google search service to be offered through these partners’ properties. For commercial partners, we provide an extensive range of customization options.\nOur Google AdSense program includes:\nGoogle AdSense for Search. For internet companies that want to target search audiences, we offer Google AdSense for search. To use AdSense for search, most of our AdSense for search partners add Google search functionality to their web pages in the form of customizable Google search boxes. We offer this service free to these partners. When visitors to these web sites search either the web site or the internet using these customizable search boxes, we display relevant ads (generally text ads) on the search results pages, targeted to match user search queries. These web sites can then generate additional revenue when visitors click on or view these ads. Because we also offer to license our web search technology along with Google AdSense for search, companies without their own search service can offer Google Web Search to improve the usefulness of their web sites for their users while increasing their revenue. We generally charge a fee related to these license agreements. We also offer a more customizable premium offering to web sites with significant traffic.\nGoogle AdSense for Content. Google AdSense for content lets web sites generate revenue from advertising by serving relevant AdWords ads targeted to web content. Web sites can use our automated sign-up process to quickly display AdWords ads on their sites. Under this program, we use automated technology to analyze the meaning of the content on the web site and serve relevant ads based on the meaning of such content. For example, a web page on an automotive blog that contains an entry about vintage cars might display ads for vintage car parts or vintage car shows. These ads are displayed in spaces that our AdSense for content partners have set aside on their web sites for our AdWords content. AdSense for content allows a variety of ad types to be shown, including text ads, display ads such as image ads and video ads, and link units (which are sets of clickable links to topic pages related to page content). We share the majority of the revenues generated from these ads with the Google Network members that display the ads. Important AdSense for content features include:\n•\nAd Format. Web sites can customize the format of texts ads will appear on their site, including the text color, size, and font.\n•\nAd Filters. Web sites can block competitive ads, or other ads they want to keep off their site, simply by telling us which URLs to block. They can also review Placement Targeted ads before they appear on their site and block certain categories of ads.\n•\nReports. Publishers can view customizable reports about their AdSense performance.\n•\nSensitive Content Filters. At times, certain ads may be inappropriate for some pages. For example, Google automatically filters out ads that would be inappropriate on a news page about a catastrophic event.\nGoogle AdSense for Domains. Google AdSense for Domains allows owners of undeveloped domains that receive traffic from users typing generic terms into browsers or search to generate revenue from relevant advertising.\nGoogle AdSense for Mobile. AdSense for Mobile allows publishers of web sites for mobile phones to generate revenue for their content by inserting relevant AdWords text and display ads on their web sites.\nGoogle AdSense for Mobile Applications. For developers creating applications for high-end mobile phones, such as the iPhone or Android-based phones, AdSense for Mobile Applications allows them to generate revenue by showing relevant advertising in their applications.\nGoogle AdSense for Video. For web sites with video content, AdSense for Video allows the web site to generate revenue from their video content by inserting relevant AdWords text and video ads within their videos.\nGoogle AdSense for Feeds. AdSense for Feeds is a free program that allows publishers to monetize their feeds through text ads targeted to the content of the feed. Feeds are content streams that users subscribe to that contain structured data such as stock and financial information, web blog posts, and weather reports.\nGoogle AdSense for Games. AdSense for Games allows web-based game developers to generate revenue by inserting relevant advertising within their games.\nGoogle Television Ads. Google Television Ads is a product that allows advertisers to use their AdWords account to create television campaigns. Advertisers can use our online advertising platform to place and monitor the effectiveness of their television ads, enhancing relevance and accountability.\nDisplay Advertising\nDisplay advertising comprises the videos, images, banners, Adobe Flash, and other interactive ads that run across the web. Today Google serves display ads across the Google Network. We also offer a variety of display ads such as videos, images, and Flash ads on YouTube. Our goal across both the Google Network and YouTube is to deliver the best possible performance for advertisers.\nWith our acquisition of DoubleClick, we also provide ad serving technology to publishers, agencies, and advertisers, which is the infrastructure that enables billions of ads to be served each day across the web. Buying and selling display advertising is still a very complicated process, and we plan to simplify that process through the evolution of these platforms.\nFinally, we recently launched the DoubleClick Ad Exchange to create an open marketplace for the trading of display ad space. This will open up the display ecosystem for participants of all sizes.\nThe Technology Behind Google’s Advertising Programs\nOur AdWords and AdSense programs serve millions of relevant, targeted ads each day based on search terms users enter or content they view on the web. The key elements of our advertising technology include:\nGoogle AdWords Auction System. The Google AdWords auction system lets advertisers automatically deliver relevant, targeted advertising. Every search query we process involves the automated execution of an auction, resulting in our advertising system often processing hundreds of millions of auctions per day. To determine whether an ad is relevant to a particular query, this system weighs an advertiser’s willingness to pay for prominence in the ad listings (the cost-per-click or cost-per-impression bid) and interest from users in the ad as measured by the click-through rate and other factors. Our Quality-based bidding system also assigns first page bids to advertiser keywords based on the Quality scores of those keywords-the higher the Quality score, the lower the first page bid. The Quality score is determined by an advertiser’s keyword click-through rate, the relevance of the ad text, historical keyword performance, the quality of the ad’s landing page and other relevancy factors. This prevents advertisers with irrelevant ads from “squatting” in top positions to gain exposure, and rewards more relevant, well-targeted ads that are clicked on frequently. Because we are paid only when users click on ads, the AdWords ranking system aligns our interests with those of our advertisers and our users. The more relevant and useful the ad, the better for our users, for our advertisers and for us.\nThe AdWords auction system also incorporates the AdWords Discounter, which automatically lowers the amount advertisers actually pay to the minimum needed to maintain their ad position. Consider a situation where there are three advertisers-Pat, Betty and Joe-each bidding on the same keyword for ads that will be displayed on Google.com. These advertisers have ads with equal click-through rates and bid $1.00 per click, $0.60 per click and $0.50 per click, respectively. With our AdWords discounter, Pat would occupy the first ad position and pay only $0.61 per click, Betty would occupy the second ad position and pay only $0.51 per click, and Joe would occupy the third ad position and pay only $0.01 per click. The AdWords discounter saves money for advertisers by minimizing the price they pay per click, while relieving them of the need to constantly monitor and adjust their cost-per-click. Advertisers can also experience greater discounts through the application of our smart pricing technology, which can reduce the price of clicks for ads served across the Google Network based on the expected value of the click to the advertiser.\nAdSense Contextual Advertising Technology. Our AdSense technology employs techniques that consider factors such as keyword analysis, word frequency and the overall link structure of the web to analyze the content of individual web pages and to match ads to them almost instantaneously. With this ad targeting technology, we can automatically serve contextually relevant ads. To do this, Google Network members embed a small amount of custom HTML code on web pages that generates a request to Google’s AdSense service whenever a user views the web page. Upon receiving a request, our software examines the content of web pages and performs a matching process that identifies advertisements that we believe are relevant to the content of the specific web page. The relevant ads are then returned to the web pages in response to the request. We employ similar techniques for matching advertisements to other forms of textual content, such as email messages and Google Groups postings. For example, our technology can serve ads offering tickets to fans of a specific sports team on a news story about that team.\nOur display advertising programs provide advertisers and publishers services related to the delivery of branded display advertising. The key elements of our display advertising technology include:\nDoubleClick Advertiser Platform. The DoubleClick Advertiser Platform provides tools for media planning, buying, selling, ad delivery, measurement, and optimization. The key technologies included in this platform are:\n•\nGoogle Ad Planner and MediaVisor.

YouTube offers analytic tools to help advertisers understand their audience and derive general business intelligence. The key solutions provided by YouTube include:\n•\nPromoted Videos. Promoted videos allows advertisers of any size to use a self-service tool to reach users who are interested in their content, products, or services.\n•\nYouTube Homepage Ads. These video ads enable advertisers to upload and promote their videos on the YouTube homepage, using several interactive formats.\n•\nEngagement Programs and Contests. These programs enable a sponsored thematic experience often using user and partner videos to present viewers with a branded experience.\n•\nDisplay and Linear ads. These ads including traditional branded display, linear ads, and video overlay ads, let advertisers monetize video playback and share money with the content owner.\n•\nClick to Buy. Click to buy allows advertisers to create a marketplace for items driven from the video playback.\nGoogle Enterprise\nSchools and businesses continue moving towards web-based applications and away from licensed software. Since web-based applications require minimal up-front investment, businesses can pay as they use them and receive automatic updates.\nThrough Google Apps, we provide hosted, web-based applications for businesses, schools, and nonprofit organizations. In addition, we provide our search technology for use within enterprises through the Google Search Appliance and on their public-facing sites with Google Site Search and Google Commerce Search.

We have over 65 offices in over 30 countries, the large majority of which includes sales people. We deploy specialized sales teams across vertical markets. We bring businesses into our advertising network through both online and direct sales channels. We work to use technology and automation wherever possible to improve the experience for our advertisers and to grow our business cost-effectively. The vast majority of our advertisers use our automated online AdWords program to establish accounts, create ads, target users, and launch and manage their advertising campaigns. Our direct advertising sales team focuses on attracting and supporting companies around the world with the largest advertising budgets. Our AdSense program follows a similar model. Most of the web sites in the Google Network sign up for AdSense using an automated online process. Our direct sales force focuses on building AdSense relationships with leading internet companies. Our display program, which includes DoubleClick and YouTube, also follows a similar model. Most advertisers and publishers sign up using an automated online process. Our direct sales force focuses on attracting and supporting advertisers and publishers around the world. Our global support organization concentrates on helping our advertisers and Google Network members get the most out of their relationship with us.\nMarketing\nWe have always believed that building a trusted, highly-recognized brand begins with providing high-quality products and services that make a notable difference in people’s lives. Our user base has grown primarily by word-of-mouth. Our early marketing efforts focused on feeding this word-of-mouth momentum and used public relations efforts to accelerate it. Through these efforts and people’s increased usage of Google worldwide, we have been able to build our brand with relatively low marketing costs as a percentage of our revenues. Today, we use the quality of our own products and services as our most effective marketing tool, and word-of-mouth momentum continues to drive consumer awareness and user loyalty worldwide. We also engage in targeted marketing efforts, such as those we deliver to our advertising clients, designed to inform potential advertisers, Google Network members, and enterprises of the benefits they can achieve through Google as well as targeted consumer marketing in certain geographies. In addition, we sponsor industry conferences and have promoted the distribution of Google products to internet users in order to make our search services easier to access.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change and converging, as well as new and disruptive, technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with information on the web and provide them with relevant advertising. We face competition from:\n•\nTraditional search engines, such as Yahoo! Inc. and Microsoft Corporation’s Bing.\n•\nVertical search engines and e-commerce sites, such as WebMD (for health queries), Kayak (travel queries), Monster.com (job queries), and Amazon.com and eBay (commerce). We compete with these sites because they, like us, are trying to attract users to their web sites to search for product or service information, and some users will navigate directly to those sites rather than go through Google.\n•\nSocial networks, such as Facebook, Yelp, or Twitter. Some users are relying more on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n•\nOther forms of advertising. We compete against traditional forms of advertising-such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, and yellow pages-for ad dollars.\n•\nMobile applications. As the mobile application ecosystem develops further, users are increasingly accessing e-commerce and other sites through those companies’ stand-alone mobile applications, instead of through search engines.\n•\nProviders of online products and services. We also provide a number of online products and services, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs, that compete directly with new and established companies that offer communication, information, and entertainment services integrated into their products or media properties.\nWe compete to attract and retain users of our search and communication products and services. Most of the products and services we offer to users are free, so we do not compete on price. Instead, we compete in this area on the basis of the relevance and usefulness of our search results and the features, availability, and ease of use of our products and services.\nNeither our users nor our advertisers are locked in to Google. For users, other search engines are literally one click away, and there are no costs to switching search engines. Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple places, both online and offline. We compete to attract and retain content providers (Google Network members, as well as other content providers for whom we distribute or license content) primarily based on the size and quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of the agreements.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants and confidentiality agreements with other third parties, and we rigorously control access to proprietary technology.\nGoogle, YouTube, DoubleClick, DART, AdSense, AdWords, Gmail, I’m Feeling Lucky, PageRank, Blogger, orkut, Picasa, SketchUp, and Postini are registered trademarks in the U.S. Our unregistered trademarks include, Blog*Spot, Jaiku, Android, Open Handset Alliance, OpenSocial, Panoramio, and Knol.\nThe first version of the PageRank technology was created while Larry and Sergey attended Stanford University, which owns a patent to PageRank. The PageRank patent expires in 2017. We hold a perpetual license to this patent. In October 2003, we extended our exclusivity period to this patent through 2011, at which point our license will become non-exclusive.\nCircumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we face increasing competition, the possibility of intellectual property claims against us grows. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims or rights against their use.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet. In addition, laws and regulations relating to user privacy, freedom of expression, content, advertising, information security, and intellectual property rights are being debated and considered for adoption by many countries throughout the world. We face risks from some of the proposed legislation that could be passed in the future.\nIn the U.S., laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, which include actions for libel, slander, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content generated by users. Certain foreign jurisdictions are also testing the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties. Any court ruling that imposes liability on providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties could harm our business.\nA range of other laws and new interpretations of existing laws could have an impact on our business. For example, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for listing, linking, or hosting third-party content that includes materials that infringe copyrights. Various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California’s Information Practices Act. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future as a result of changes in interpretation. Furthermore, any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.\nSimilarly, the application of existing laws prohibiting, regulating, or requiring licenses for certain businesses of our advertisers, including, for example, online gambling, distribution of pharmaceuticals, adult content, financial services, alcohol, or firearms, can be unclear. Application of these laws in an unanticipated manner could expose us to substantial liability and restrict our ability to deliver services to our users.\nWe also face risks due to government failure to preserve the internet’s basic neutrality as to the services and sites that users can access through their broadband service providers. Such a failure to enforce network neutrality could limit the internet’s pace of innovation and the ability of large competitors, small businesses, and entrepreneurs to develop and deliver new products, features, and services, which could harm our business.\nWe are also subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data, including personal health records. We post on our web site our privacy policies and practices concerning the use and disclosure of user data. Any failure by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or privacy related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could potentially harm our business. In addition, the interpretation of data protection laws, and their application to the internet, in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions is unclear and in a state of flux. There is a risk that these laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Further, any failure by us to protect our users’ privacy and data could result in a loss of user confidence in our services and ultimately in a loss of users, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, because our services are accessible worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions have claimed and others may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees, or infrastructure.\nCulture and Employees\nWe take great pride in our culture. We embrace collaboration and creativity and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex technical challenges. Transparency and open dialog are central to us, and we like to make sure that company news, whether about product launches, industry news and innovations, or organizational changes, reaches our employees first through internal channels like weekly TGIF meetings, Tech Talks, blogs, and messages from leadership.\nWe have evolved into a software, technology, internet, mobile, advertising, and media company all rolled into one. We take technology innovation very seriously and compete aggressively for talent across the globe. We strive to hire the best computer scientists and engineers to help us solve very significant challenges across systems design, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data mining, networking, software engineering, testing, distributed systems, cluster design, and other areas. We work hard to provide an environment where these talented people can have fulfilling jobs and produce technological innovations that have a positive effect on the world through daily use by millions of people.\nDespite our rapid growth, we still cherish our roots as a startup, and we give employees the freedom to act on their ideas regardless of their level within the company. This spirit has spurred some of our most impactful global initiatives, including Google Flu Trends, which uses search data to estimate global flu activity, GoogleServe, our annual company-wide community service event, and products like Google News, orkut, and Android.\nWe aim to reflect the globally diverse audience of our products in our employee population and believe that we can serve our users better when we foster diverse perspectives and ideas within the company. We provide very significant rewards for individuals and teams that provide great value to us, our advertisers, and our users. The commitment to maintaining and enhancing these programs year after year supports Google’s culture of innovation and performance and also keeps employee interests aligned with those of the company.\nAt December 31, 2009, we had 19,835 employees, consisting of 7,443 in research and development, 7,338 in sales and marketing, 2,941 in general and administrative and 2,113 in operations. All of Google’s employees are also equityholders, with significant collective employee ownership.\nSeasonality\nBoth seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\nAvailable Information\nOur web site is located at www.google.com, and our investor relations web site is located at http://investor.google.com. The following filings are available through our investor relations web site after we file them with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our Proxy Statements for our annual stockholder’s meetings (for the last two years). We also provide a link to the section of the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov that has all of our public filings. Our Quarterly Reports, Annual Reports, and Proxy Statements for the last two years are also available for download free of charge on our investor relations web site. Further, a copy of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is located at the\nSEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room can be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding our filings at www.sec.gov.\nWe webcast our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host with members of the investment community on our investor relations web site.

         "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe face intense competition.\nOur business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and is subject to changing technology, shifting user needs and frequent introductions of new products and services. We have many competitors in different industries, including traditional search engines, vertical search engines and e-commerce sites, social networking sites, traditional media companies, and providers of online products and services. Our current and potential competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Established companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and end users, and they can use their experience and resources against us in a variety of competitive ways, including by making acquisitions, investing aggressively in research and development, and competing aggressively for advertisers and web sites. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, and content providers, our revenues and growth rates could decline.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.\nOur success depends on providing products and services that make using the internet a more useful and enjoyable experience for our users. Our competitors are constantly developing innovations in web search, online advertising, and web based products and services. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our web search technology and our existing products and services and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. If we are unable to provide quality products and services, then our users may become dissatisfied and move to a competitor’s products and services. In addition, these new products and services may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if users of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, and Google Network members, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities, or are not effectively brought to market. As search technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer search results that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.\nWe generate our revenues almost entirely from advertising, and the reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could seriously harm our business.\nWe generated 97% of our revenues in both 2008 and 2009 from our advertisers. Our advertisers can generally terminate their contracts with us at any time. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in advertising with us does not generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, or if we do not deliver\ntheir advertisements in an appropriate and effective manner. In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. If we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertisers, they may stop placing ads with us, which would negatively harm our revenues and business.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, Google Network members, and other partners.\nThe brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the “Google” brand is critical to expanding our base of users, advertisers, Google Network members, and other partners. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the internet market. Our brand may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including service outages, product malfunctions, and data privacy and security issues. If we fail to maintain and enhance the “Google” brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality products and services, which we may not do successfully.\nWe are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business.\nThe growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields implicate a variety of new regulatory issues and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Moreover, our competitors have employed and will likely continue to employ significant resources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in countries where we have significant operations. Legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users, require us to incur substantial costs, or change our business practices. These changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business.\nA variety of new and existing U.S. and foreign laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject us to claims or other remedies. Many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies. The laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. For example, the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the U.S. and abroad. Claims have been threatened and filed under both U.S. and foreign laws for defamation, libel, slander, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, copyright and trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users, our products and services, or content generated by our users.\nIn addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for listing or linking to third-party web sites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California’s Information Practices Act. We face similar risks and costs as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.\nAcquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences.\nWe have acquired a number of businesses in the past, including our acquisitions of DoubleClick and Postini. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. In particular, we expect to increase the number of acquisitions we make in 2010 compared to 2009. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:\n•\nImplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.\n•\nDiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges.\n•\nCoordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions.\n•\nTransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.\n•\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization.\n•\nRetention of employees from the businesses we acquire.\n•\nIntegration of the acquired company’s accounting, management information, human resource, and other administrative systems.\n•\nLiability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.\n•\nLitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\n•\nIn the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\n•\nFailure to successfully further develop the acquired technology.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\nFuture acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize. For example, we have yet to realize significant revenue benefits from our acquisition of YouTube.\nOur international operations are subject to increased risks which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nInternational revenues accounted for approximately 51% of our total revenues in 2008 and approximately 53% of our total revenues in 2009. More than half of our user traffic came from outside the U.S. in 2009. We have limited experience with operations outside the U.S. and our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n•\nChallenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences and by doing business with foreign agencies and governments.\n•\nLonger payment cycles in some countries.\n•\nUncertainty regarding liability for services and content.\n•\nCredit risk and higher levels of payment fraud.\n•\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to manage these fluctuations under our foreign exchange risk management program.\n•\nForeign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.\n•\nImport and export requirements that may prevent us from shipping products or providing services to a particular market and may increase our operating costs.\n•\nPotentially adverse tax consequences.\n•\nHigher costs associated with doing business internationally.\n•\nDifferent employee/employer relationships and the existence of workers’ councils and labor unions.\nIn addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions and could interfere with our ability to offer, or prevent us from offering, our products and services to one or more countries or expose us or our employees to fines and penalties. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export requirements, content requirements, trade restrictions, tax laws, sanctions, internal and disclosure control rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, labor relations laws, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business, and damage to our reputation. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies. Any such violations could include prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services to one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of users’ and customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services.\nFrom time to time, concerns have been expressed about whether our products and services compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, as nearly all of our products and services are web based, the amount of data we store for our users on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users’ data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web based products and services we offer as well as increase the number of countries where we operate.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of data protection laws in Europe and elsewhere are still uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe expect our revenue growth rate to decline and anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\nWe believe our revenue growth rate will generally decline as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition, the inevitable decline in growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels, and the increasing maturity of the online advertising market. We believe our operating margin will experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for many aspects of our business. Our operating margin will also experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our Google Network members’ web sites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on our own web sites or if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote the distribution of certain products, including Google Toolbar. The margin on revenues we generate from our Google Network members is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our web sites. Additionally, the margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google Network members.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date, and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this Item 1A and the following factors may affect our operating results:\n•\nOur ability to continue to attract users to our web sites and satisfy existing users on our web sites.\n•\nOur ability to monetize (or generate revenues from) traffic on our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites.\n•\nOur ability to attract advertisers to our AdWords program.\n•\nOur ability to attract web sites to our AdSense program.\n•\nThe mix in our revenues between those generated on our web sites and those generated through our Google Network.\n•\nThe amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and our ability to manage the resulting risk through our foreign exchange risk management program.\n•\nThe amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure.\n•\nOur focus on long-term goals over short-term results.\n•\nThe results of our investments in risky projects.\n•\nOur ability to keep our web sites operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions.\n•\nOur ability to achieve revenue goals for partners to whom we guarantee minimum payments or pay distribution fees.\n•\nOur ability to generate significant revenues from services in which we have invested considerable time and resources, such as YouTube and Google Checkout.\nBecause our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results. In addition, advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions as well as budgeting and buying patterns. Also, user traffic tends to be seasonal. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights as well as to our products and services. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.\nAlthough we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Changes in patent law, such as changes in the law regarding patentable subject matter, can also impact our ability to obtain patent protection for our innovations. In addition, given the costs of obtaining patent protection, we may choose not to protect certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nWe also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nCompanies in the internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. As we have grown, the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase. Our products, services, and technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims and regardless of the merits of the claim, intellectual property claims are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue any of our services or practices that are found to be in violation of another party’s rights.\nWe also may have to seek a license to continue such practices, which may significantly increase our operating expenses. In addition, many of our agreements with our Google Network members and other partners require us to indemnify these members for certain third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims.\nCompanies have filed trademark infringement and related claims against us over the display of ads in response to user queries that include trademark terms. The outcomes of these lawsuits have differed from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We currently have three cases pending at the European Court of Justice, which will address questions regarding whether advertisers and search engines can be held liable for use of trademarked terms in keyword advertising. We are litigating, or have recently litigated similar issues in other cases, in the U.S., Australia, Austria, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.\nWe have also had copyright claims filed against us by companies alleging that features of certain of our products and services, including Google Web Search, Google News, Google Video, Google Image Search, Google Book Search, and YouTube, infringe the rights of others. In the U.S. we announced a settlement with the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers. However, this class action settlement is subject to approval by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and we may be subject to additional claims with respect to Google Book Search both in the U.S. and in other parts of the world. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain functionalities, and may also result in a change in our business practices, which could result in a loss of revenues for us or otherwise harm our business. In addition, any time one of our products or services links to or hosts material in which others allegedly own copyrights, we face the risk of being sued for copyright infringement or related claims. Because these products and services comprise the majority of our products and services, the risk of harm from such lawsuits could be substantial.\nWe have also had patent lawsuits filed against us alleging that certain of our products and services, including Android, Google Web Search, Google AdWords, Google AdSense, Google Talk, and Google Chrome, infringe patents held by others. In addition, the number of demands for license fees and the dollar amounts associated with each request continue to increase. Adverse results in these lawsuits, or our decision to license patents based upon these demands, may result in substantial costs and, in the case of adverse litigation rulings, could prevent us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, which could result in a loss of revenues for us or otherwise harm our business.\nMore individuals are using devices other than personal computers to access the internet. If users of these devices do not widely adopt versions of our web search technology, products, or operating systems developed for these devices, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile telephones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), smart phones, handheld computers, video game consoles, and television set-top devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years. The lower resolution, functionality, and memory associated with some alternative devices make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users, manufacturers, or distributors of alternative devices. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. We have limited experience to date in operating versions of our products and services developed or optimized for users of alternative devices, such as Google Mobile and Android, or in designing and selling alternative devices, such as the Nexus One. As new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such devices. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, distributors, and users to our products and services, or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices, we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services, which could adversely affect our business.\nNew technologies could block our ads, which would harm our business.\nTechnologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads. Most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages. As a result, ad-blocking technology could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we fail to detect click fraud or other invalid clicks, we could lose the confidence of our advertisers, which would cause our business to suffer.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraudulent clicks and other invalid clicks on our ads from a variety of potential sources. We have regularly refunded fees that our advertisers have paid to us that were later attributed to click fraud and other invalid clicks, and we expect to do so in the future. Invalid clicks are clicks that we have determined are not intended by the user to link to the underlying content, such as inadvertent clicks on the same ad twice and clicks resulting from click fraud. Click fraud occurs when a user intentionally clicks on a Google AdWords ad displayed on a web site for a reason other than to view the underlying content. While we have implemented systems to identify and reduce fraudulent and invalid clicks, an increase in refunds could negatively affect our profitability and damage our brand.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities. Any\nerrors or vulnerabilities in our products and services, or damage to or failure of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services, which could reduce our revenues and profits, and damage our brand.\nIndex spammers could harm the integrity of our web search results, which could damage our reputation and cause our users to be dissatisfied with our products and services.\nThere is an ongoing and increasing effort by “index spammers” to develop ways to manipulate our web search results. For example, because our web search technology ranks a web page’s relevance based in part on the importance of the web sites that link to it, people have attempted to link a group of web sites together to manipulate web search results. We take this problem very seriously because providing relevant information to users is critical to our success. If our efforts to combat these and other types of index spamming are unsuccessful, our reputation for delivering relevant information could be diminished. This could result in a decline in user traffic, which would damage our business.\nOur business and operations are experiencing rapid growth. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational, and financial infrastructure. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our products and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and operating results. Our expansion and growth in international markets heighten these risks as a result of the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute systems, regulatory systems, and commercial infrastructures. To effectively manage this growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures. These systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our financial position.\nWe rely on our Google Network members for a significant portion of our revenues, and we benefit from our association with them. The loss of these members could adversely affect our business.\nWe provide advertising, web search, and other services to our Google Network members, which accounted for 31% of our revenues in 2008 and 30% of our revenues in 2009. Some of the participants in this network may compete with us in one or more areas. They may decide in the future to terminate their agreements with us. If our Google Network members decide to use a competitor’s or their own web search or advertising services, our revenues would decline. Our agreements with a few of the largest Google Network members account for a significant portion of revenues derived from our AdSense program. If our relationship with one or more large Google Network members were terminated or renegotiated on terms less favorable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\nAlso, certain of our key Google Network members operate high-profile web sites, and we derive tangible and intangible benefits from this affiliation. If one or more of these key relationships is terminated or not renewed, and is not replaced with a comparable relationship, our business would be adversely affected.\nIf we were to lose the services of Eric, Larry, Sergey, or other members of our senior management team, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In particular, our CEO, Eric Schmidt, and our founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, are critical to the overall management of Google as well as the development of our technology, our culture, and our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of any of our management or key personnel could seriously harm our business.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, and mobile communications companies. Some of these providers have stated that they may take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. While interference with access to our popular products and services seems unlikely, such carrier interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth.\nTo the extent our revenues are paid in foreign currencies, and currency exchange rates become unfavorable, we may lose some of the economic value of the revenues in U.S. dollar terms.\nAs we expand our international operations, more of our customers may pay us in foreign currencies. Since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. For instance, if currency exchange rates were to change unfavorably, the U.S. dollar equivalent of our operating income recorded in foreign currencies would be diminished. Hedging strategies, such as forward contracts, options, and foreign exchange swaps that we have implemented or may implement to mitigate this risk may not reduce or completely offset our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations. Additionally, hedging programs expose us to risks that could adversely affect our financial results, including the following:\n•\nWe have limited experience in implementing or operating hedging programs. Hedging programs are inherently risky and we could lose money as a result of poor trades.\n•\nWe may be unable to hedge currency risk for some transactions or match the accounting for the hedge with the exposure because of a high level of uncertainty or the inability to reasonably estimate our foreign exchange exposures.\n•\nWe may be unable to acquire foreign exchange hedging instruments in some of the geographic areas where we do business, or, where these derivatives are available, we may not be able to acquire enough of them to fully offset our exposure.\n•\nWe may determine that the cost of acquiring a foreign exchange hedging instrument outweighs the benefit we expect to derive from the derivative, in which case we would not purchase the derivative and would be exposed to unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.\n•\nTo the extent we recognize a gain on a hedge transaction in one of our subsidiaries that is subject to a high statutory tax rate, and a loss on the related hedged transaction that is subject to a lower rate, our effective tax rate would be higher.\n•\nSignificant fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could greatly increase our hedging costs.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. Our determination of our tax liability is always subject to review by applicable tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price for our Class A common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been volatile since our initial public offering and will likely continue to be volatile. For example, in 2009, the price of our Class A common stock ranged from $282.75 per share to $625.99 per share. The trading price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n•\nQuarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors.\n•\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments.\n•\nRecommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.\n•\nAnnouncements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance on earnings.\n•\nAnnouncements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.\n•\nThe volume of shares of Class A common stock available for public sale.\n•\nSales of stock by us or by our stockholders.\n•\nShort sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Class A common stock (including derivative transactions under our Transferable Stock Option (TSO) program).\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company’s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe concentration of our capital stock ownership with our founders, executive officers, and our directors and their affiliates will limit our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2009, our founders, executive officers, and directors (and their affiliates) together owned shares of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and other equity interests representing approximately 70% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. In particular, as of December 31, 2009, our two founders and our CEO, Larry, Sergey, and Eric, owned approximately 90% of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing approximately 68% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Larry, Sergey, and Eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets, for the foreseeable future. This concentrated control limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class common stock structure. As a result of this structure, our founders, executives, and employees have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\n•\nOur board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.\n•\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders’ meeting.\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n•\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n•\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.",

         "ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we are involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations, and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property claims, breach of contract claims, labor and employment claims, tax, and other matters. Although claims, suits, investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the resolution of our current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flow. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. In addition, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could in the future materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. See the risk factors “Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand” and “We are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require us to pay damages, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEPA Investigation\nIn February 2009, we learned of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation into an alleged release of refrigerant at one of our smaller data facilities, which we acquired from DoubleClick, and the accuracy of related statements and records. We are cooperating with the EPA and have provided documents and other materials. The EPA investigation could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other administrative action.\nWhile we currently believe this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, we have noted it in accord with SEC regulations that call for disclosure of certain environmental proceedings that may result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more.",

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOur Class A common stock has been listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since August 19, 2004. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our stock. The following table sets forth for the indicated periods the high and low sales prices per share for our Class A common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nOur Class B common stock is neither listed nor traded.\nHolders of Record\nAs of January 29, 2010, there were approximately 2,721 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock, and the closing price of our Class A common stock was $529.94 per share as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. As of January 29, 2010, there were approximately 90 stockholders of record of our Class B common stock.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock.

Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in particular, the risks discussed under the heading “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and those discussed in other documents we file with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nGoogle is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. Our innovations in web search and advertising have made our web site a top internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. We serve three primary constituencies:\n•\nUsers. We provide users with products and services that enable people to more quickly and easily find, create, and organize information that is useful to them.\n•\nAdvertisers. We provide advertisers with cost-effective ways to deliver online ads, as well as offline ads on television, to customers across Google sites and through the Google Network, which is the network of online and offline third parties that use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads with their search results and content.\n•\nGoogle Network Members and Other Content Providers. We provide the online and offline members of our Google Network with our Google AdSense programs. These include programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on the web sites of our Google Network members as well as programs to deliver ads on television broadcasts. We share most of the fees these ads generate with our Google Network members, thereby creating an important revenue stream for them. In addition, we have entered into arrangements with other content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content, and we may display ads next to or as part of this content on the pages of our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites. We share most of the fees these ads generate with these content providers and our Google Network members, thereby creating an important revenue stream for these partners.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nAdvertising revenues made up 99% of our revenues in 2007 and 97% of our revenues in 2008 and 2009. We derive most of our additional revenues from offering display advertising management services to advertisers, ad agencies, and publishers, as well as licensing our enterprise products, search solutions, and web search technology.\nGoogle AdWords is our automated online program that enables advertisers to place targeted text-based and display ads on our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites. Display advertising typically includes static or animated images as well as interactive audio or video media, such as the banner ads on the tops or sides of many popular web sites. Most of our AdWords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites as specified by the advertiser. For advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-click pricing, we recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results on our web sites or next to the search results or content on our Google Network\nmembers’ web sites. For advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-impression pricing, we recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time their ads are displayed on our web sites or the Google Network members’ web sites. Our AdWords agreements are generally terminable at any time by our advertisers.\nGoogle AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on the web sites of our Google Network members as well as programs to deliver ads on television. Our AdSense programs include AdSense for search and AdSense for content.\nAdSense for search is our online service for distributing relevant ads from our advertisers for display with search results on our Google Network members’ sites. To use AdSense for search, most of our AdSense for search partners add Google search functionality to their web pages in the form of customizable Google search boxes. When visitors of these web sites search either the web site or the internet using these customizable search boxes, we display relevant ads on the search results pages, targeted to match user search queries. Ads shown through AdSense for search are text ads.\nAdSense for content is our online service for distributing ads from our advertisers that are relevant to content on our Google Network members’ web sites. Under this program, we use automated technology to analyze the meaning of the content on the web page and serve relevant ads based on the meaning of such content. For example, a web page on an automotive blog that contains an entry about vintage cars might display ads for vintage car parts or vintage car shows. These ads are displayed in spaces that our AdSense for content partners have set aside on their web sites. AdSense for content allows a variety of ad types to be shown, including text ads, image ads, Google Video Ads, link units (which are sets of clickable links to topic pages related to page content), themed units (which are regular text ads with graphic treatments that change seasonally and by geography), and gadget ads (which are customized “mini-sites” that run as ads on AdSense publisher web sites).\nFor our online AdSense program, our advertisers pay us a fee each time a user clicks on one of our advertisers’ ads displayed on our Google Network members’ web sites or, for those advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression pricing, as their ads are displayed. To date, we have paid most of these advertiser fees to our Google Network members, and we expect to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. We recognize these advertiser fees as revenue and the portion of the advertiser fee we pay to our Google Network members as traffic acquisition costs under cost of revenues. In some cases, we guarantee our Google Network members minimum revenue share payments based on their achieving defined performance terms, such as number of search queries or advertisements displayed. Google Network members do not pay any fees associated with the use of our AdSense program on their web sites.\nOur agreements with Google Network members consist largely of uniform online “click-wrap” agreements that members enter into by interacting with our registration web sites. The standard agreements have no stated term and are terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both the standard agreements and the negotiated agreements contain provisions requiring us to share with the Google Network member most of the advertiser fees generated by users clicking on ads on the Google Network member’s web site or, for advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression pricing, as the ads are displayed on the Google Network member’s web site.\nGoogle TV Ads enable advertisers, operators, and programmers to buy, schedule, deliver, and measure ads on television. We recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time an ad is displayed on television.\nWe also offer display advertising management services such as media planning, buying, implementation, and measurement tools for advertisers and agencies and forecasting and reporting tools for publishers. We recognize the related fees as licensing and other revenues in the period advertising impressions are delivered.\nIn January 2010, we launched our mobile phone business. We will recognize fees derived from the sale of mobile phones as licensing and other revenues in the period in which the mobile phones are delivered.\nWe have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. Our agreements with content providers are typically standard agreements with no stated term and are terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both the standard agreements and the negotiated agreements contain provisions requiring us to pay the content providers for the content we license. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers and Google Network members. We recognize these advertiser fees as revenue. We recognize the portion of the advertiser fees we pay to our content providers as content acquisition costs under cost of revenues and the portion we pay to our Google Network members as traffic acquisition costs. In some cases, we guarantee our content providers minimum revenue share or other payments.\nWe believe the factors that influence the success of our advertising programs include the following:\n•\nThe relevance, objectivity, and quality of our search results and the relevance and quality of ads displayed with each search results page.\n•\nThe number of searches initiated at our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites and the underlying purpose of these searches (for instance, whether they are for academic research, to find a news article, or to find a product or service).\n•\nThe number and prominence of ads displayed on our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites.\n•\nThe number of visits to, and the content of, our Google Network members’ web sites and certain of our web sites and the relevance and quality of the ads we display next to this content.\n•\nThe advertisers’ return on investment from advertising campaigns on our web sites or our Google Network members’ web sites compared to other forms of advertising.\n•\nThe total advertising spending budgets of each advertiser.\n•\nThe number of advertisers and the breadth of items advertised.\n•\nThe amount we ultimately pay our Google Network members, distribution partners, and our content providers for traffic, access points, and content compared to the amount of revenue we generate.\nTrends in Our Business\nOur business has grown rapidly since inception, resulting in substantially increased revenues, and we expect that our business will continue to grow. However, our revenue growth rate has generally declined over time, and we expect it will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors including increasing competition, the difficulty of maintaining growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels and increasing maturity of the online advertising market in certain countries. In addition, weak economic conditions have generally adversely impacted our revenue growth rate and may result in fewer commercial queries by our users and may cause advertisers to reduce the amount they spend on online advertising, including the amount they are willing to pay for each click or impression, which could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues. Further, a slow or uneven pace of economic recovery could also negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues.\nThe main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to our users, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites. These steps include not displaying ads that generate low click-through rates or that send users to irrelevant or otherwise low quality sites and terminating our relationships with those Google Network members whose web sites do not meet our quality requirements. We may also continue to take steps to reduce the number of accidental clicks by our users. These steps could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues.\nBoth seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenues, as well as paid click and average cost-per-click growth rates.\nThe operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our Google Network members’ web sites through our AdSense program is significantly lower than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from ads placed on our web sites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on Google Network members’ web sites are shared with our Google Network members. For the past five years, growth in advertising revenues from our web sites has generally exceeded that from our Google Network members’ web sites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future, although the relative rate of growth in revenues from our web sites compared to the rate of growth in revenues from our Google Network members’ web sites may vary over time.\nWe continue to invest in building the necessary employee and systems infrastructures required to manage our growth and develop and promote our products and services, and this may cause our operating margins to decrease. We have generally experienced and expect to continue to experience growth in our operations as we build our research and development programs, expand our base of users, advertisers, Google Network members, and content providers, and increase our presence in international markets. Also, we have acquired and expect to continue to acquire businesses and other assets from time to time. In particular, we expect to increase the number of acquisitions we make in 2010 compared to 2009. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product offerings. Our full-time employee headcount was 20,222 at December 31, 2008 and 19,835 at December 31, 2009. In the past few quarters, we made efforts to improve the discipline of our hiring process and to focus on better managing our expense growth. However, we expect to continue to invest in our business, including significantly increasing our hiring rate, and this may cause our operating margins to decrease.\nWe expect our cost of revenues will increase in dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, and credit card and other transaction fees, content acquisition costs, and other costs, including the costs of the mobile phones that we sell. In particular, traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may increase in the future if we are unable to continue to improve the monetization or generation of revenues from traffic on our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites, including with those members to whom we have guaranteed minimum revenue share payments.\nOur international revenues have grown as a percentage of our total revenues from 51% 2008 to 53% in 2009. This increase in the portion of our revenues derived from international markets results largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs, and our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products in these international markets. The increase in the proportion of international revenues derived from international markets continues to increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates. For example, in 2009, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and the British pound) had an unfavorable impact on our revenues. We have a foreign exchange risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies. However, this program will not fully offset the effect of fluctuations on our revenues and earnings.\nRecent Development\nIn January 2010, we announced our decision to review our business operations in China and that we are discussing with the Chinese government the basis on which we could operate an unfiltered search engine pursuant to local law. These discussions may result in our shutting down Google.cn, and potentially our offices in China. The ultimate outcome, including any related exit costs we might incur, is unknown at this time.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our historical operating results as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated:\nRevenues\nThe following table presents our revenues, by revenue source, for the periods presented (in millions):\nThe following table presents our revenues, by revenue source, as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented:\nGrowth in our revenues from 2008 to 2009 resulted primarily from growth in advertising revenues generated by Google web sites, and to a lesser extent, Google Network members’ web sites. Our advertising revenue growth for Google web sites and Google Network members’ web sites resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs, partially offset by a decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. In addition, the growth in advertising revenues benefited from more hedging gains recognized under our foreign exchange risk management program. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic, certain monetization improvements, and the continued global expansion of our products, our advertiser base and our user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network members. The decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was primarily the result of the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies (primarily the British pound and the Euro), as well as changes in geographical mix due to traffic growth in emerging markets, where average cost-per-clicks are typically lower, compared to more mature markets. In addition, the decrease in the average cost-per-click was due to changes in how we believe advertisers managed their advertising costs in response to the uncertain economic conditions. Specifically, we believe that, as a result of the economic downturn and continuing economic uncertainty, advertisers, in aggregate, lowered their bids for keywords in response to a decrease in sales they were able to make per paid click.\nGrowth in our revenues from 2007 to 2008 resulted primarily from growth in advertising revenues for Google web sites, and to a lesser extent, Google Network members’ web sites. Our advertising revenue growth for Google web sites and Google Network members’ web sites resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs, and to a lesser extent, an increase in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. In addition, the growth in advertising revenues benefited from hedging gains recognized under our foreign exchange risk management program in 2008. We recognized no such gains in 2007. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic, certain monetization improvements, and the continued global expansion of our products, our advertiser base and our user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network members. The increase in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was partially the result of the general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and the Japanese yen).\nImprovements in our ability to ultimately monetize increased traffic primarily relate to enhancing the end user experience, including providing end users with ads that are more relevant to their search queries or to the content on the Google Network members’ web sites they visit. For instance, these improvements include, providing end users with multiple site links for certain web search results, reducing the minimum cost-per-click resulting in the display of more relevant ads, changing the formula used to determine which ads appear at the top of our search results pages, and changing the clickable area around our AdSense for content text-based ads to only the title and URL to reduce the number of accidental clicks. In addition, we have further enhanced the accuracy of our quality scoring, which is our measurement of an ad’s click-through rate and other relevancy factors.\nAggregate paid clicks on Google web sites and Google Network members’ web sites increased approximately 15% from 2008 to 2009 and approximately 18% from 2007 to 2008. Average cost-per-click on Google web sites and Google Network members’ web sites decreased approximately 7% from 2008 to 2009 and increased approximately 7% from 2007 to 2008. The rate of change in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click, and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors including the revenue growth rates on our web sites compared to those of our Google Network members, advertiser competition for keywords, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, seasonality, the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs, and general economic conditions. In addition, traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals also contributes to these fluctuations. Changes in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click may not be indicative of our performance or advertiser experiences in any specific geographic market, vertical, or industry.\nWe believe that the increase in the number of paid clicks on Google web sites and Google Network members’ web sites is substantially the result of our commitment to improving the relevance and quality of both our search results and the advertisements displayed, which we believe results in a better user experience, which in turn results in more searches, advertisers, and Google Network members and other partners.\nRevenues by Geography\nDomestic and international revenues as a percentage of consolidated revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our advertisers, are set forth below.\nThe growth in international revenues (other than the United Kingdom) as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2008 to 2009 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs and our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products for these international markets, partially offset by the net effect of the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) and the related hedging gains.\nThe decrease in revenues from the United Kingdom as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2008 to 2009 resulted largely from the effect of the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the British pound, partially offset by more hedging gains realized from our foreign exchange risk management program in 2009 as compared to 2008.\nThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies (primarily the British pound and the Euro) from 2008 to 2009 had an unfavorable impact on our international revenues (international revenues increased $1,297.0 million during this period). Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our total revenues would have been approximately $1.03 billion, or 4.3%, higher in 2009. This is before consideration of hedging gains recognized to revenues of $167.8 million and $324.7 million in 2008 and 2009.\nThe growth in international revenues from 2007 to 2008 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs and increases in our direct sales resources and customer support operations in international markets, our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products for these international markets, the favorable effect of the general weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and the Japanese yen) as well as hedging gains realized in 2008 from our foreign exchange risk management program. We recognized no such gains in 2007.\nAlthough we expect to continue to invest in international markets, these investments may not result in an increase in our international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2010 or thereafter. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about geographic areas.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately paid to our Google Network members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search queries to our web site (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share arrangements with our Google Network members and distribution partners.\nCertain AdSense agreements obligate us to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to Google Network members based on their achieving defined performance terms, such as number of search queries or\nadvertisements displayed. These fees may be paid in advance or in arrears and are non-refundable but are subject to adjustment based on the achievement of the defined performance terms. In addition, the arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our Google Network members may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. To the extent we expect revenues generated under an arrangement to exceed the guaranteed minimum revenue share payments, we recognize traffic acquisition costs on a contractual revenue share basis or on a basis proportionate to forecasted revenues, whichever is greater. Otherwise, we recognize the guaranteed revenue share payments as traffic acquisition costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the related agreements. For AdSense agreements under which we only pay on a contractual revenue share basis, we recognize the revenue share obligations as traffic acquisition costs at the same time we recognize the related revenue. Also, concurrent with the commencement of a small number of AdSense and other agreements, we have purchased certain items from, or provided other consideration to, our Google Network members and partners. We have determined that certain of these amounts are prepaid traffic acquisition costs and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related agreements.\nIn addition, certain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not exclusively-or at all-based on revenue share. The fees are non-refundable. Further, these arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts, we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. We recognize fees under these arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points (approximately two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year, or based on any contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, we expense the fees as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenues.\nCost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy and bandwidth costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and content acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements we display ads on the pages of our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers and the Google Network members. To the extent we are obligated to make guaranteed minimum revenue share or other payments to our content providers, we recognize content acquisition costs equal to the greater of the following three amounts: 1) the contractual revenue share amount, if any, 2) an amount that is based on the number of times the content is displayed, or 3) an amount calculated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the agreements. The following tables present our cost of revenues and cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, and our traffic acquisition costs and traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues, for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nCost of revenues increased $222.6 million from 2008 to 2009. The increase was primarily related to an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $249.1 million from our distribution arrangements as a result of more distribution fees paid and more traffic directed to our web sites. This was partially offset by a decrease in traffic acquisition costs of $18.7 million from our AdSense arrangements primarily as a result of more revenue realized from Google Network members to whom we paid less revenue share. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of advertising revenues from our web sites compared to our Google Network members’ web sites, as well as more revenue realized from Google Network members to whom we paid less revenue share.\nCost of revenues increased $1,972.4 million from 2007 to 2008. The increase was primarily related to an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $1,005.1 million primarily resulting from more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program. The increase was also related to an increase of $675.2 million in data center costs primarily resulting from the depreciation of additional information technology assets and data center buildings as well as additional labor required to manage the data centers. In addition, there was an increase in the amortization of developed technology of $133.0 million resulting primarily from our DoubleClick acquisition, and an increase in expenses related to acquiring content on our web sites of $106.0 million. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of advertising revenues coming from our web sites rather than from our Google Network members’ web sites.\nWe expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2010 and in future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, credit card and other transaction fees, content acquisition, and other costs, including the costs of the mobile phones that we sell. Traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors, including the following:\n•\nThe relative growth rates of revenues from our web sites and from our Google Network members’ web sites.\n•\nWhether we are able to enter into more AdSense arrangements that provide for lower revenue share obligations or whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential Google Network members results in less favorable revenue share arrangements, including arrangements with guaranteed minimum payments.\n•\nWhether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites, particularly with those members to whom we have guaranteed minimum revenue share payments.\n•\nThe relative growth rates of expenses associated with distribution arrangements and the related revenues generated, including whether we share with certain existing and new distribution partners proportionately more of the aggregate advertising fees that we earn from paid clicks derived from search queries these partners direct to our web sites.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents our research and development expenses, and research and development expenses as a percentage of our revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel responsible for the research and development of new products and services, as well as significant improvements to existing products and services. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.\nResearch and development expenses increased $49.8 million from 2008 to 2009. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor related costs of $138.3 million largely as a result of a 14% increase in research and development headcount, partially offset by a decrease in professional services costs of $73.8 million, the majority of which were related to consulting costs, and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of $22.6 million as certain intangible assets have been fully amortized.\nResearch and development expenses increased $673.2 million from 2007 to 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities related costs of $387.1 million as a result of a 25% increase in research and development headcount. In addition, there was an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $162.6 million.\nWe expect that research and development expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2010 and future periods because we expect to continue to invest in building the necessary employee and systems infrastructures required to support the development of new, and improve existing, products and services.\nSales and Marketing\nThe following table presents our sales and marketing expenses, and sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel engaged in customer service and sales and sales support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenditures.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $37.7 million from 2008 to 2009. This increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expense of $104.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in travel, conference and related expenses of $49.8 million.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $484.9 million from 2007 to 2008. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities related costs of $373.1 million mostly as a result of a 20% increase in sales and marketing headcount. In addition, stock-based compensation expense increased $74.4 million.\nWe anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2010 and future periods as we expand our business on a worldwide basis.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe following table presents our general and administrative expenses, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel and facilities related to our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, and fees for professional services. Professional services are principally comprised of outside legal, audit, information technology consulting, and outsourcing services.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $135.3 million from 2008 to 2009. This decrease was primarily related to the settlement agreement with the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers (AAP) under which we recognized $95.1 million of expense in 2008. In addition, consulting costs decreased $59.6 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $523.3 million from 2007 to 2008. This increase was primarily related to an increase in professional services of $243.0 million, the majority of which were related to legal costs, including the aforementioned legal settlement with the Authors Guild and the AAP. In addition, there was an increase in labor and facilities related costs of $137.8 million, primarily as a result of a 9% increase in general administrative headcount from 2007 to 2008, and an increase in bad debt expense of $96.1 million due to the general economic downturn.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table presents our stock-based compensation and stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nIn March 2009, we completed an offer to exchange certain employee stock options issued under Google’s 2004 Stock Plan (the Exchange). Certain previously granted options were exchanged for new stock options with a lower exercise price granted on a one-for-one basis. Options for an aggregate of approximately 7.6 million shares of Google’s Class A common stock were exchanged. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have an exercise price of $308.57 per share, the closing price of Google’s Class A common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 6, 2009. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have a new vesting schedule determined by adding 12 months to each vesting date under the exchanged options’ original vesting schedule. In addition, new options will vest no sooner than six months after the date of the Exchange. The Exchange resulted in a modification charge of approximately $360 million which is being recognized over the vesting periods of the new options. These vesting periods range from six months to approximately five years. We recorded approximately $103 million of the modification charge in 2009.\nStock-based compensation increased $44.3 million from 2008 to 2009. This increase was largely due to the modification charge recognized in 2009, as well as additional stock awards issued to existing and new employees. This increase was partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense as a result of a significant amount of equity awards which fully vested in 2008, as well as an increase to the overall estimated forfeiture rate.\nStock-based compensation increased $251.2 million from 2007 to 2008. This increase was primarily due to additional stock awards issued to existing and new employees.\nImpairment of Equity Investments\nIn the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.09 billion, which was primarily comprised of $726.0 million and $355.0 million related to our investments in America Online, Inc. (AOL) and Clearwire Corporation (Clearwire). We subsequently sold our investment in AOL in the second quarter of 2009. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInterest Income and Other, Net\nInterest income and other, net decreased $247.4 million from 2008 to 2009. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in interest income of $159.9 million due to lower yields on our cash and investment balances and an increase in net foreign exchange related costs of $87.9 million primarily due to more hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program.\nInterest income and other, net decreased $273.2 million from 2007 to 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by an increase in net foreign exchange related costs of $155.7 million primarily due to more hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program, and a decrease in interest income of $169.7 million due to lower yields on our cash and investment balances. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in realized gains on sales of marketable securities of $43.0 million.\nThe costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities that we recognized to interest income and other, net are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts as well as the volatility of the foreign exchange rates.\nAs we expand our international business, we believe costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program may increase in dollar amount in 2010 and future periods.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for income taxes, and effective tax rate for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nOur provision for income taxes increased from 2008 to 2009, primarily as a result of increases in federal and state income taxes, driven by higher taxable income year over year. Our effective tax rate decreased from 2008 to 2009, primarily as a result of the amount of the impairment charge of equity investments recorded in 2008 compared to the related benefit.\nOur provision for income taxes increased from 2007 to 2008, primarily as a result of increases in federal and state income taxes, driven by higher taxable income year over year. Our effective tax rate increased from 2007 to 2008, primarily as a result of the amount of the impairment charge of equity investments compared to the related benefit, and due to greater net gains recognized on hedges of certain intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program in a legal entity where we have a higher statutory tax rate and greater net losses recognized on the related hedged transactions in legal entities where we have lower statutory tax rates, partially offset by proportionately higher earnings in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates.\nOur effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates. Our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our provision for income taxes.\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nYou should read the following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. You should also keep in mind, as you read the following tables, that our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2009. This table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for fair presentation of our financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2009.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn summary, our cash flows are as follows (in millions):\nAt December 31, 2009 we had $24.5 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, time deposits, money market mutual funds, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate securities. Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K describes further the composition of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. At December 31, 2008 and 2009, we had unused letters of credit for approximately $109.9 million and $101.2 million. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. Also, if the banking system or the financial markets further deteriorate or remain volatile, our investment portfolio may be impacted and the values and liquidity of our investments could be adversely affected. In addition, we may make acquisitions or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund any such acquisitions and licensing activities. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us. During the second half of 2009, we entered into agreements to acquire On2 Technologies, Inc. (On2) and AdMob, Inc. (AdMob). In the first quarter of 2010, we entered into an amendment to our agreement to acquire On2 pursuant to which we agreed to increase the consideration payable to On2 stockholders. The aggregate consideration payable to On2 stockholders is approximately $124 million in stock and cash based on the\nclosing price of our Class A common stock on February 10, 2010. The aggregate consideration payable to AdMob stockholders is $750 million in stock. The completion of these transactions is subject to customary closing conditions, and stockholder approval for On2. We expect On2 to close in the first quarter of 2010 and AdMob to close in the first half of 2010.\nCash provided by operating activities consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities, deferred income taxes, and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. Cash provided by operating activities in 2009 was $9,316.2 million and consisted of net income of $6,520.4 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $2,309.8 million and cash provided by working capital and other activities of $486.0 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,240.0 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, $1,164.1 million of stock-based compensation expense and $284.3 million of amortization of intangibles and other, partially offset by $268.1 million of deferred income taxes on earnings and $90.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a decrease of $262.0 million in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $243.1 million which is a direct result of the growth of our business, and a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $217.5 million, which includes the same $90.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities included under adjustments for non-cash items, and an increase in accrued revenue share of $157.7 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase of $504.0 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers. The increase in net income taxes payable and deferred income taxes was primarily a result of additional tax obligations accrued, partially offset by an increase in the amount of estimated income taxes we paid during the year. The increase in accrued revenue share was due to the growth in our AdSense and distribution programs and the timing of payments made to our partners.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2008 was $7,852.9 million and consisted of net income of $4,226.9 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $3,298.8 million, and cash provided by working capital and other activities of $327.2 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,212.2 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, $1,119.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $1,094.8 million of impairment charges of equity investments, partially offset by $224.6 million of deferred income taxes on earnings and $159.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $626.0 million, which includes the same $159.1 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities included under adjustments for non-cash items, and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $338.9 million. The increases in accrued expenses are a direct result of the growth of our business and an increase in headcount. These increases to working capital activities were partially offset by an increase of $334.5 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers, a decrease of $211.5 million in accounts payable due to the timing of invoice processing and payments and an increase of $147.1 million in prepaid revenue shares, expenses, and other assets.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2007 was $5,775.4 million and consisted of net income of $4,203.7 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $1,253.1 million, and cash provided by working capital and other activities of $318.6 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $868.6 million of stock-based compensation expense and $807.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, partially offset by $379.2 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $744.8 million, which includes the same $379.2 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities included under adjustments for non-cash items, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $418.9 million, an increase in accrued revenue share of $150.3 million, an increase in accounts payable of $70.1 million, and an increase in deferred revenue of $70.3 million. The increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses are a direct result of the growth of our business and an increase in headcount. These increases to working capital activities were partially offset by an increase of $837.2 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers and an increase of $298.7 million in prepaid revenue shares, expenses, and other assets.\nAs we expand our business internationally, we have offered payment terms to certain advertisers that are standard in their locales, but longer than terms we would generally offer to our domestic advertisers. This may increase our working capital requirements and may have a negative effect on cash provided by our operating activities. Also, as a result of our decision to review our business operations in China, we may incur exit costs related to the potential shut down of Google.cn and our China offices.\nCash used in investing activities in 2009 of $8,019.2 million was primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of $7,036.2 million and capital expenditures of $809.9 million.\nCash used in investing activities in 2008 of $5,319.4 million was primarily attributable to cash consideration used in acquisitions and other investments of $3,367.5 million primarily related to the acquisition of DoubleClick and capital expenditures of $2,358.5 million, partially offset by net maturities and sales of marketable securities of $406.5 million including our investment in Clearwire.\nCash used in investing activities in 2007 of $3,681.6 million was attributable to capital expenditures of $2,402.8 million, cash consideration used in acquisitions and other investments of $941.2 million, primarily related to the acquisition of Postini, and net purchases of marketable securities of $337.6 million.\nCapital expenditures are mainly for the purchase of information technology assets. In order to manage expected increases in internet traffic, advertising transactions, and new products and services, and to support our overall global business expansion, we will make significant investments in data center operations, technology, corporate facilities, and information technology infrastructure in 2010 and thereafter. However, the amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis.\nIn addition, we expect to spend a significant amount of cash on acquisitions and other investments from time to time. In particular, we expect to increase the number of acquisitions we make in 2010 compared to 2009. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies and our product offerings. In connection with certain acquisitions, we are obligated to make additional cash payments if certain criteria are met. As of December 31, 2009, the remaining contingent obligation amount related to these acquisitions was approximately $35 million, which if the criteria are met, would be recorded as part of the purchase. Since these contingent payments are based on the achievement of performance targets, actual payments may be substantially lower.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2009 of $233.4 million was primarily due to net proceeds related to stock-based award activities of $143.1 million. Net proceeds result when the cash we receive upon the exercise of stock options exceeds the tax withholding payments we make on behalf of our employees upon the net settlement of their vested restricted stock units. In addition, there were excess tax benefits of $90.3 million from stock-based award activities during the period which represented a portion of the $260.2 million reduction to income taxes payable that we recorded in 2009 related to the total direct tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale, or vesting of these awards.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2008 of $87.6 million was due primarily to excess tax benefits of $159.1 million from stock-based award activities during the period which represents a portion of the $250.9 million reduction to income tax payable that we recorded in 2008 related to the total direct tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale, or vesting of these awards, partially offset by net payments related to stock-based award activities of $71.5 million.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2007 of $403.1 million was due primarily to excess tax benefits of $379.2 million from stock-based award activities during the period and net proceeds related to stock-based award activities of $23.9 million.\nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2009\nThe above table does not include contingent consideration that may be paid pursuant to asset purchases or business combinations. It also does not include payments related to toolbar and other product distribution arrangements as those arrangements do not include guaranteed obligations.\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring between 2010 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table above. Certain of these leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations represent non-cancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 2009. In addition, we had $1.9 billion of open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods at December 31, 2009. This amount is not included in the above table because we have the right to cancel the purchase orders prior to the date of delivery. The majority of our non-cancelable contractual obligations are related to data center operations and facility build-outs.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities consist of cash obligations, primarily the legal settlement with the Authors Guild and the AAP and milestone and royalty payments owed in connection with certain acquisitions and licensing agreements.\nIn addition, we recognized additional long-term taxes payable of $496.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2009 related to tax positions for which the timing of the ultimate resolution is uncertain. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the table above.\nGuaranteed Minimum Revenue Share Payments\nIn connection with our AdSense revenue share agreements, we are periodically required to make non-cancelable guaranteed minimum payments to a small number of our Google Network members over the term of the respective contracts. Under our contracts, these guaranteed payments may be adjusted downward based on our Google Network members not achieving defined performance targets, such as number of advertisements displayed or search queries. We believe the amounts included in the table above represent a reasonable estimate of the future minimum guaranteed payments. Actual guaranteed payments may differ from the estimates. To date, the aggregate advertiser fees generated under these AdSense agreements have exceeded the aggregate guaranteed minimum revenue share payments.\nAt December 31, 2009, our aggregate outstanding non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue share commitments totaled $133.3 million through 2012 compared to $1,030.3 million at December 31, 2008.\nOff-Balance Sheet Entities\nAt December 31, 2009, we did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nAlthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.\nOur effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, state taxes, certain benefits realized related to stock option activities, and research and experimentation tax credits. The effective tax rates were 25.9%, 27.8%, and 22.2% for 2007, 2008, and 2009. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur stock-based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricing model and is recognized as expense over the\nrequisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and option life. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our marketable securities, as well as our non-marketable equity securities, for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is “other-than-temporary.” Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period, and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the investment before recovery. If any impairment is considered “other-than-temporary,” we will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our Consolidated Statement of Income.\nEffect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new accounting standard which changes the consolidation rules as they relate to variable interest entities. Specifically, the new standard makes significant changes to the model for determining who should consolidate a variable interest entity, and also addresses how often this assessment should be performed. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2010 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides additional guidance on the measurement of liabilities at fair value. Specifically, when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, the new standard requires that the fair value of a liability be measured using one or more of the valuation techniques that should maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In addition, an entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of a liability. We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. Specifically, the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In the absence of the vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of the selling prices, consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on management’s best estimate of the selling prices. In addition, the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation. In October 2009, the FASB also issued a new accounting standard which changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements. Specifically, tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the tangible products’ essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the multiple-element arrangements revenue recognition guidance discussed above. Both standards will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2011. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted these new accounting standards in the first quarter of 2010 using the prospective method and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Had we adopted these new standards in 2009, the impact on our consolidated financial statements would have been immaterial.",
         "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nEconomic Exposure\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies. This exposes us to foreign currency risk. We purchase foreign exchange option contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The gain on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest income and other, net, if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring. Any gain after a hedge is de-designated or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized as interest income and other, net, immediately.\nAt December 31, 2008, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros were 1.9 billion (or approximately $2.6 billion) and $152.0 million; the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds were £1.1 billion (or approximately $1.8 billion) and $277.9 million; and the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars were C$229.7 million (or approximately $202.2 million) and $21.8 million. At December 31, 2009, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros were 1.6 billion (or approximately $2.2 billion) and $59.0 million; the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds were £809.1 million (or approximately $1.3 billion) and $39.4 million; and the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars were C$306.2 million (or approximately $267.9 million) and $5.9 million. These foreign exchange options have maturities of 36 months or less. There are no other foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. However, we may enter into similar contracts in other foreign currencies in the future.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% for our foreign currencies instruments could be experienced in the near term.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 20%, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income before tax effect would have been approximately $325 million and $15 million lower at December 31, 2008 and 2009, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest income and other, net, would have been approximately $15 million and $68 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20%, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income before tax effect would have been approximately $750 million and $555 million higher at December 31, 2008 and 2009, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest income and other, net, would have been approximately $85 million and $75 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009.\nTransaction Exposure\nOur exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary, primarily the Euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. Our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency. We have entered into foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary.\nThe notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars for foreign currencies was $54.2 million and $115.4 million at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with other currencies was 630.5 million (or approximately $897.6 million) and 618.0 million (or approximately $889.3 million) at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros for other foreign currencies was 7.9 million (or approximately $11.3 million) at December 31, 2009.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $16 million and $102 million at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. The adverse impact at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $555 million and $594 million from forward exchange contracts in place for the months of December 2008 and December 2009. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before taxes in the near term.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, time deposits, money market mutual funds, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate securities. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.\nInvestments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our income from investments may decrease in the future.\nWe considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis-point) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable securities of approximately $83 million and $291 million at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009.",
         "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nGoogle Inc.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nFinancial Statements:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe supplementary financial information required by this Item 8 is included in Item 7 under the caption “Quarterly Results of Operations.”\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders\nGoogle Inc.\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Google Inc. at December 31, 2008 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 12, 2010\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders\nGoogle Inc.\nWe have audited Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Google Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, Google Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 of Google Inc. and our report dated February 12, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 12, 2010\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except par value per share)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(In thousands)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In thousands)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Google Inc. and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nWe were incorporated in California in September 1998. We were re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. We provide highly targeted advertising and global internet search solutions as well as hosted applications.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Google and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, fair values of prepaid revenue share, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards, and income taxes, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table presents our revenues by revenue source (in thousands):\nGoogle AdWords is our automated online program that enables advertisers to place targeted text-based and display ads on our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites. Display advertising includes static or animated images as well as interactive audio or video media, such as the banner ads on the tops or sides of many popular web sites. Most of our AdWords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites as specified by the advertiser.\nGoogle AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on the web sites of our Google Network members as well as programs to deliver ads on television broadcasts.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nWe recognize as revenues the fees charged advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the text-based ads that are displayed next to the search results pages on our site or on the search results pages or content pages of our Google Network members’ web sites and, for those advertisers who use our cost-per impression pricing, the fees charged advertisers each time an ad is displayed on our members’ sites. We report our Google AdSense revenues on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisers.\nGoogle TV Ads enable advertisers, operators, and programmers to buy, schedule, deliver, and measure ads on television. We recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time an ad is displayed on television in accordance with the terms of the related agreements.\nWe also offer display advertising management services such as media planning, buying, implementation, and measurement tools for advertisers and agencies and forecasting and reporting tools for publishers. We recognize the related fees as licensing and other revenues in the period advertising impressions are delivered.\nGoogle Checkout is our online shopping payment processing system for both consumers and merchants. We recognize as revenues any fees charged to merchants on transactions processed through Google Checkout. Further, cash ultimately paid to merchants under Google Checkout promotions, including cash paid to merchants as a result of discounts provided to consumers on certain transactions processed through Google Checkout, are accounted for as an offset to revenues.\nWe generate fees from search services on a per-query basis. Our policy is to recognize revenues from per-query search fees in the period we provide the search results.\nWe also generate fees from the sale and license of our Search Appliance products, which include hardware, software, and post-contract support primarily for two years. As the deliverables are not sold separately, sufficient vendor-specific objective evidence does not exist for the allocation of revenue. As a result, we recognized the entire fee for the sale and license of these products ratably over the term of the post-contract support arrangement. Beginning the first quarter of 2010, we adopted the new accounting guidance which requires us to allocate the consideration of the arrangement to each of the deliverables based on our best estimate of their selling prices as there is no vendor-specific objective or third-party evidence of the selling prices. As a result, we now recognize revenue allocated to the hardware and software at the time of sale and revenue allocated to post-contract support ratably over the term of the service arrangement.\nIn addition, we generate fees through the license of our Google Apps products. We recognize as revenue the fees we charge customers for hosting the related enterprise applications and services ratably over the term of the service arrangement.\nRevenues realized through display advertising management services, Google TV Ads, Google Checkout, search services, Search Appliance, and Google Apps were not material in any of the years presented.\nWe recognize revenues as described above because the services have been provided, the fees we charge are fixed or determinable, we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed-upon transactions and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe record deferred revenue when payments are received in advance of our performance in the underlying agreement on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately paid to our Google Network members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search queries to our web site (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share arrangements with our Google Network members and distribution partners.\nCertain AdSense agreements obligate us to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to Google Network members based on their achieving defined performance terms, such as number of search queries or advertisements displayed. These fees may be paid in advance or in arrears and are non-refundable but are subject to adjustment based on the achievement of the defined performance terms. In addition, the arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our Google Network members may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. To the extent we expect revenues generated under an arrangement to exceed the guaranteed minimum revenue share payments, we recognize traffic acquisition costs on a contractual revenue share basis or on a basis proportionate to forecasted revenues, whichever is greater. Otherwise, we recognize the guaranteed revenue share payments as traffic acquisition costs on a straight-line basis over the term of the related agreements. For AdSense agreements under which we only pay on a contractual revenue share basis, we recognize the revenue share obligations as traffic acquisition costs at the same time the related revenue is recognized. Also, concurrent with the commencement of a small number of AdSense and other agreements, we have purchased certain items from, or provided other consideration to, our Google Network members and partners. We have determined that certain of these amounts are prepaid traffic acquisition costs and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related agreements.\nIn addition, certain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not exclusively-or at all-based on revenue share. These fees are non-refundable. Further, these arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. We recognize fees under these arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points (approximately two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year, or based on any contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenues. Further, we review the access points for impairment by distribution partner, type, and geography, and we have not made any impairment to date.\nPrepaid revenue share and distribution fees are included in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions including Google Checkout transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as content acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our web sites and our Google Network members’ web sites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers and the Google Network members. To the extent we are obligated to make guaranteed minimum revenue share or other payments to our content providers, we recognize content acquisition costs equal to the greater of the following three amounts: 1) the contractual revenue share\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\namount, if any, 2) an amount that is based on the number of times the content is displayed, or 3) an amount calculated on a straight-line basis over the terms of the agreements.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe have elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. Shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the statutory withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of RSUs outstanding. Furthermore, we record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us as a reduction to additional paid-in capital when paid. Also, we recognize stock-based compensation using the straight-line method.\nWe include as part of cash flows from financing activities the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax-effected compensation of the related stock-based awards for options exercised and RSUs vested during the period. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $137.2 million, $72.5 million, and $350.2 million, and the total direct tax benefit realized, including the excess tax benefit, from stock-based award activity was $463.2 million, $250.9 million, and $260.2 million. We have elected to account for the indirect effects of stock-based awards-primarily the research and development tax credit-through the income statement.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009, we recognized stock-based compensation and related tax benefits of $868.6 million and $143.0 million, $1,119.8 million and $231.7 million, and $1,164.1 million and $264.0 million.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nOur revenues are principally derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, our revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the globe. Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, time deposits, money market funds, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate securities. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various major corporations and financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the globe. In 2007, 2008, and 2009, we generated approximately 52%, 49%, and 47% of our revenues from customers based in the U.S., with the majority of customers outside of the U.S. located in Europe and Japan. Many of our Google Network members are in the internet industry. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend, but generally we do not require collateral from our customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations.\nNo advertiser or Google Network member generated greater than 10% of revenues in 2007, 2008, and 2009.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value because of their generally short maturities. We carry marketable securities and foreign currency contracts at fair value. See Notes 3 and 4 below for more information.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nWe invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign government, time deposits, money market mutual funds, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate securities. We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities.\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as available-for-sale. We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other than temporary which we record as interest income and other, net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of interest income and other, net.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe have accounted for non-marketable equity security investments primarily at cost because we do not have significant influence over the underlying investees.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our marketable securities, as well as our non-marketable equity securities, for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is “other-than-temporary.” Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period, and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the investment before recovery. If any impairment is considered “other-than-temporary,” we will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we do not charge interest. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers. We determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nProperty and Equipment\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. We depreciate buildings over periods up to 25 years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property (including land) and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. Depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for their intended use.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed to external users, before technological feasibility of such products is reached. We have determined that technological feasibility was reached shortly before the release of those products and as a result, the development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before the release of those products were not material, and accordingly, were expensed as incurred. Software development costs also include costs to develop software programs to be used solely to meet our internal needs. The costs we incurred during the application development stage for these software programs were not material in the years presented.\nLong-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. We have made no material adjustments to our long-lived assets in any of the years presented. In addition, we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired. Our tests are based on our single operating segment and reporting unit structure. We found no material impairment in any of the years presented.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis with definite lives over periods ranging primarily from one to 12 years.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize income taxes under the liability method. We recognize deferred income taxes for differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity. We recorded $61.0 million of\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nnet translation gains in 2007, $84.2 million of net translation losses in 2008, and $76.7 million of net translation gains in 2009. We record net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions as a component of interest income and other, net. These gains and losses are net of those realized on forward foreign exchange contracts. We recorded $16.2 million and $35.6 million of net losses in 2007 and 2008, and $8.2 million of net gains in 2009 from assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the local currency.\nLegal Costs\nLegal costs are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $236.7 million, $266.4 million, and $353.4 million.\nSubsequent Events\nIn May 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which established general accounting standards and disclosure for subsequent events. In accordance with this standard, we evaluated subsequent events through February 12, 2010, the date we filed this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nEffect of Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which changes the consolidation rules as they relate to variable interest entities. Specifically, the new standard makes significant changes to the model for determining who should consolidate a variable interest entity, and also addresses how often this assessment should be performed. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2010 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides additional guidance on the measurement of liabilities at fair value. Specifically, when a quoted price in an active market for the identical liability is not available, the new standard requires that the fair value of a liability be measured using one or more of the valuation techniques that should maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In addition, an entity is not required to include a separate input or adjustment to other inputs relating to the existence of a restriction that prevents the transfer of a liability. We adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which provides guidance for arrangements with multiple deliverables. Specifically, the new standard requires an entity to allocate consideration at the inception of an arrangement to all of its deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In the absence of the vendor-specific objective evidence or third-party evidence of the selling prices, consideration must be allocated to the deliverables based on management’s best estimate of the selling prices. In addition, the new standard eliminates the use of the residual method of allocation. In October 2009, the FASB also issued a new accounting standard which changes revenue recognition for tangible products containing software and hardware elements. Specifically, tangible products containing software and hardware that function together to deliver the tangible products’ essential functionality are scoped out of the existing software revenue recognition guidance and will be accounted for under the multiple-element arrangements revenue recognition guidance discussed above. Both standards will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2011. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted these\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nnew accounting standards in the first quarter of 2010 using the prospective method and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Had we adopted these new standards in 2009, the impact on our consolidated financial statements would have been immaterial.\nNote 2. Net Income Per Share of Class A and Class B Common Stock\nWe compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period except that it does not include unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, warrants, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and warrants is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Further, there are a number of safeguards built into our Certificate of Incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation which would have the affect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock (in this case the right of our Class A common stock to receive an equal dividend to any declared on our Class B common stock) must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our Certificate of Incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.\nNote 3. Cash and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist of the following (in thousands):\nThe following table summarizes unrealized gains and losses related to our investments in marketable securities designated as available-for-sale (in thousands):\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nGross unrealized gains and losses on cash equivalents were not material at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009.\nOur corporate debt securities are primarily guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) or the sovereign guarantee of foreign governments under similar programs to the TLGP.\nOur agency residential mortgage-backed securities are specified pools of mortgage pass-through securities that are guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises. Our commercial mortgage-backed securities are fully defeased securities with underlying collateral loans replaced by U.S. Treasury notes.\nOur marketable equity security consists of our investment in Clearwire.\nWe recognized gross realized gains of $105.8 million and $118.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009. Gross realized losses were not material in all periods presented. We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we reflect such gains and losses as a component of interest income and other, net, in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable securities, excluding the marketable equity security, designated as available-for-sale and classified by the contractual maturity date of the security (in thousands):\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe following tables presents gross unrealized losses and fair values for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2008 and 2009, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2008 and 2009, we did not have any investments in marketable securities that were in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater.\nAuction Rate Securities\nAt December 31, 2009, we held $181.7 million of auction rate securities (ARS). The assets underlying these 33 individual investments are primarily student loans which are mostly AAA rated and substantially guaranteed by the U.S. government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Historically, these securities have provided liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals every 7 to 49 days. However, these auctions began to fail in the first quarter of 2008. Since these auctions have failed, we have realized higher interest rates for many of these ARS than we would have otherwise. Although we have been receiving interest payments at these generally higher rates, the related principal amounts will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuer calls the security, or the security matures according to contractual terms. Maturity dates for these ARS investments range from 2025 to 2047. Since these auctions have failed, $65.3 million of the related securities were called at par by their issuers.\nAs a result of the auction failures, these ARS do not have a readily determinable market value. To estimate their fair values at December 31, 2009, we used a discounted cash flow model based on estimated interest rates, timing, and amount of cash flows, the credit quality of the underlying securities, and illiquidity considerations. Specifically, we estimated the future cash flows of our ARS over the expected workout periods using a projected weighted-average interest rate of 4.15% per annum, which is based on the forward swap curve at the end of December 2009 plus any additional basis points currently paid by the issuers assuming these auctions continue to\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nfail. A discount factor was applied over these estimated cash flows of our ARS, which is calculated based on the interpolated forward swap curve adjusted by up to 2,000 basis points to reflect the current market conditions for instruments with similar credit quality at the date of the valuation and additionally adjusted for a liquidity discount of up to 400 basis points to reflect the risk in the marketplace for these investments that has arisen due to the lack of an active market.\nAt December 31, 2009, the estimated fair value of these ARS was $23.4 million less than their costs. As we have no intent to sell these ARS and it is more-likely-than-not that we will not be required to sell these ARS prior to recovery, we concluded the decline in the fair value was temporary and recorded the unrealized loss to accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009.\nTo the extent we determine that any impairment is other-than-temporary, we would record a charge to earnings. In addition, we have concluded that the auctions for these securities may continue to fail for at least the next 12 months and as a result, we classified them as non-current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009.\nLiquidation of Investment in AOL\nIn 2009, we recognized a gain of $9.0 million on the sale of our equity investment in America Online, Inc. to Time Warner Inc. for $283.0 million.\nNote 4. Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and fair value of certain marketable securities will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as interest income and other, net, as part of revenues, or to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe use options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We initially report any gain on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and we subsequently reclassify those gains to revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest income and other, net, if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring.\nAt December 31, 2009, the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was $15.5 million, of which $8.9 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI to revenues within the next 12 months.\nWe recognize any gain after a hedge is de-designated or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge in interest income and other, net, immediately. Further, we exclude the change in the time value of the options from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We record the premium paid or time value of an option whose strike price is equal to or greater than the market price on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter, we recognize any change to this time value in interest income and other, net.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros was 1.9 billion (or approximately $2.6 billion) and 1.6 billion (or approximately $2.2 billion) at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009; the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds was £1.1 billion (or approximately $1.8 billion) and £809.1 million (or approximately $1.3 billion) at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009; and the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars was C$229.7 million (or approximately $202.2 million) and C$306.2 million (or approximately $267.9 million) at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. These foreign exchange options have maturities of 36 months or less. There were no other foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.\nFair Value Hedges\nIn November 2009, we began using forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in interest income and other, net along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in the time value for forward contacts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize them in interest income and other, net. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $37.3 million at December 31, 2009.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts as well as the related costs in interest income and other, net, along with the gains and losses of the related hedged items. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $2.6 billion and $2.4 billion at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars for foreign currencies was $54.2 million and $115.4 million at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with other currencies was 630.5 million (or approximately $897.6 million) and 618.0 million (or approximately $889.3 million) at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros for other foreign currencies was 7.9 million (or approximately $11.3 million) at December 31, 2009.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2008 and 2009 is summarized below (in thousands):\nThe effect of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationship on income and other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009 is summarized below (in thousands):\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nGains (losses) related to the ineffectiveness portion of the hedges were not material in all periods presented.\nThe effect of derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationship on income for the year ended December 31, 2009 is summarized below (in thousands):\nGains (losses) related to the ineffectiveness portion and the amount excluded from effectiveness testing of the hedges were not material.\nThe effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009 is summarized below (in thousands):\nNote 5. Fair Value Measurements\nWe measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, ARS, and foreign currency derivative contracts at fair value. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2-Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs which are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2. This is because we value our cash equivalents and marketable securities using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. We classify our investments in ARS within Level 3 because they are valued using valuation techniques (see Note 3). Some of the inputs to these models are unobservable in the market and are significant. We classify our foreign currency derivative contracts within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in thousands):\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe following table presents reconciliations for our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in thousands):\nNote 6. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):\nNote 7. Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2009, we completed ten acquisitions for a total cash consideration of $91.6 million. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 4.0 years and customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 6.4 years.\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price for all of the above acquisitions (in thousands):\nOn August 5, 2009, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with On2 Technologies, Inc. (On2), a publicly-held company and developer of video compression technology. In January 2010, we entered into an\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\namendment to the Agreement and Plan of Merger with On2. Upon the consummation of the merger, each stockholder of On2 will have the right to receive 0.0010 shares of Google Class A common stock, $0.15 of cash, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares. The total purchase price is approximately $124 million based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on February 10, 2010. The completion of this transaction is subject to On2 stockholder approval. We expect this transaction to close in the first quarter of 2010.\nOn November 9, 2009, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire AdMob, Inc., a privately-held mobile display ads technology provider, for $750 million in Google Class A common stock. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. We expect this transaction to close in the first half of 2010.\nNote 8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows (in thousands):\nInformation regarding our acquisition-related intangible assets that are being amortized is as follows (in thousands):\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nPatents and developed technology, customer relationships, and tradenames and other have weighted-average useful lives from the date of purchase of 4.0 years, 6.4 years, and 4.6 years. Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009 was $158.2 million, $279.7 million, and $266.2 million. As of December 31, 2009, expected amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter was as follows (in thousands):\nNote 9. Interest Income and Other, Net\nThe components of interest income and other, net are as follows (in thousands):\nNote 10. Comprehensive Income\nThe changes in the components of other comprehensive income are as follows (in thousands):\n(1) Change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments is recorded net of taxes of $20.0 million, $8.9 million, and $6.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008, and 2009.\n(2) Change in unrealized gains on cash flow hedges is recorded net of taxes of $144.4 million and $138.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as follows (in thousands):\nNote 11. Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring between 2010 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table below. Certain of these arrangements have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis.\nAt December 31, 2009, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases, along with sublease income amounts, were as follows over each of the next five years and thereafter (in thousands):\nCertain leases have adjustments for market provisions. Amounts in the table above represent our best estimates of future payments to be made under these leases. Rent expense under operating leases, including co-location arrangements, was $164.3 million, $313.6 million, and $323.2 million in 2007, 2008, and 2009.\nGuaranteed Minimum Revenue Share Payments\nIn connection with our AdSense revenue share agreements, we are periodically required to make non-cancelable guaranteed minimum payments to a small number of our Google Network members over the term of the respective contracts. Under our contracts, these guaranteed payments may be adjusted downward based on our Google Network members not achieving defined performance targets, such as number of advertisements displayed or search queries. In most cases, certain guaranteed amounts will be adjusted downward if our Google Network members do not meet their performance targets. In all of these AdSense agreements, if a Google Network member were unable to perform under the contract, such as being unable to provide search queries, as defined under the terms of that agreement, then we would not be obligated to make any non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue payments to that member. At December 31, 2009, our aggregate outstanding non-cancelable guaranteed minimum revenue share commitments totaled $133.3 million through 2012 compared to $1,030.3 million at December 31, 2008. We believe these amounts represent a reasonable estimate of the future minimum guaranteed payments.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nPurchase Obligations\nWe had $360.7 million of other non-cancelable contractual obligations and $1.9 billion of open purchase orders for which we had not received the related services or goods at December 31, 2009. We have the right to cancel these open purchase orders prior to the date of delivery. The majority of our non-cancelable contractual obligations are related to data center operations and facility build-outs.\nLetters of Credit\nAt December 31, 2009 and associated with several leased facilities, we had unused letters of credit for $101.2 million. At December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with our financial covenants under the letters of credit.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business to facilitate transactions of our services and products, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network members, and lessors with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, the payments we have made under these agreements have not had a material impact on our operating results, financial position, or cash flows.\nLegal Matters\nCompanies have filed trademark infringement and related claims against us over the display of ads in response to user queries that include trademark terms. The outcomes of these lawsuits have differed from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We currently have three cases pending at the European Court of Justice, which will address questions regarding whether advertisers and search engines can be held liable for use of trademarked terms in keyword advertising. We are litigating, or have recently litigated similar issues in other cases, in the U.S., Australia, Austria, Brazil, Chile, China, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom.\nWe have also had copyright claims filed against us alleging that features of certain of our products and services, including Google Web Search, Google News, Google Video, Google Image Search, Google Book Search, and YouTube, infringe their rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements or orders preventing us from offering certain functionalities, and may also result in a change in our business practices, which could result in a loss of revenue for us or otherwise harm our business. In addition, any time one of our products or services links to or hosts material in which others allegedly own copyrights, we face the risk of being sued for copyright infringement or related claims. Because these products and services comprise the majority of our products and services, our business could be harmed in the event of an adverse result in any of these claims.\nWe have also had patent lawsuits filed against us alleging that certain of our products and services, including Android, Google Web Search, Google AdWords, Google AdSense, and Google Chrome, infringe patents held by others. In addition, the number of demands for license fees and the dollar amounts associated with each request\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\ncontinue to increase. Adverse results in these lawsuits, or our decision to license patents based upon these demands, may result in substantial costs and, in the case of adverse litigation results, could prevent us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, which could result in a loss of revenue for us or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are also a party to other litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property claims (in addition to the trademark and copyright matters noted above), labor and employment claims and threatened claims, breach of contract claims, tax, and other matters.\nAlthough the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of the matters discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEPA Investigation\nIn February 2009, we learned of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation into an alleged release of refrigerant at one of our smaller data facilities, which we acquired from DoubleClick, and the accuracy of related statements and records. We are cooperating with the EPA and have provided documents and other materials. The EPA investigation could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other administrative action.\nWe currently believe this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are currently under audit by the Internal Revenue Service and various other tax authorities. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of tax benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\nNote 12. Stockholders’ Equity\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized 100,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. At December 31, 2008 and 2009, there were no shares issued or outstanding.\nClass A and Class B Common Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. At December 31, 2009, there were 6,000,000,000 and 3,000,000,000 shares authorized and there were 243,611,368 and 74,160,683 shares legally outstanding of Class A and Class B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock. We refer to Class A and Class B common stock as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nStock Plans\nWe maintain the 1998 Stock Plan, the 2000 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan (No. 2), the 2003 Stock Plan (No. 3), the 2004 Stock Plan, and plans assumed through acquisitions, all of which are collectively referred to as the “Stock Plans.” Under our Stock Plans, incentive and nonqualified stock options or rights to purchase common stock may be granted to eligible participants. Options are generally granted for a term of 10 years. Except for options granted pursuant to the Exchange discussed below, options granted under the Stock Plans generally vest 25% after the first year of service and ratably each month over the remaining 36 month period contingent upon employment with us on the vesting date. Options granted under Stock Plans other than the 2004 Stock Plan may be exercised prior to vesting.\nUnder the Stock Plans, we have also issued RSUs and restricted shares. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our stock at the time of vest. RSUs issued to new employees vest over four years with a yearly cliff contingent upon employment with us on the dates of vest. These RSUs vest from zero to 50.0% of the grant amount at the end of each of the four years from date of hire based on the employee’s performance. RSUs under the Founders’ Award programs are issued to individuals on teams that have made extraordinary contributions to Google. These awards vest quarterly over four years contingent upon employment with us on the vesting dates.\nAt December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009, there were 23,236,325 and 27,042,948 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plans.\nWe estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the BSM option pricing model. Our assumptions about stock-price volatility have been based exclusively on the implied volatilities of publicly traded options to buy our stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life of options granted to our employees. Through the third quarter of 2007, our assumptions about the expected term had been based on that of companies that had option vesting and contractual terms, expected stock volatility, employee demographics, and physical locations that were similar to ours because we had limited relevant historical information to support the expected sale and exercise behavior of our employees who had been granted options recently. Commencing in the fourth quarter of 2007, we began to estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock options granted (excluding options granted in connection with the Exchange discussed below) in the periods presented:\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our options for the year ended December 31, 2009:\n(1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the closing stock price of $619.98 of our Class A common stock on December 31, 2009.\n(2) The number of options granted and canceled/forfeited includes options granted and canceled in connection with the Exchange (see below).\n(3) Options expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nThe following table summarizes additional information regarding outstanding, exercisable, and exercisable and vested stock options at December 31, 2009:\nThe above tables include approximately 1.5 million warrants held by selected financial institutions that were options purchased from employees under our TSO program, with a weighted-average exercise price of $303.82.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nThe total grant date fair value of stock options vested during 2007, 2008, and 2009 was $635.1 million, $692.5 million, and $689.7 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of all options and warrants exercised during 2007, 2008 and 2009 was $1,279.0 million, $503.2 million, and $566.1 million. These amounts do not include the aggregate sales price of options sold under our TSO program.\nDuring 2009, the number of shares underlying TSOs sold to selected financial institutions under the TSO program was approximately 1.1 million at a total value of $246.8 million, or an average of $231.36 per share, including an average premium of $23.39 per share. The premium is calculated as the difference between (a) the sale price of the TSO and (b) the intrinsic value of the TSO, which we define as the excess, if any, of the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the sale over the exercise price of the TSO. At December 31 2009, the number of options eligible for participation under the TSO program was approximately 10 million.\nIn March 2009, we completed an offer to exchange certain employee stock options issued under our 2004 Stock Plan. Certain previously granted options were exchanged for new options with a lower exercise price granted on a one-for-one basis. Options for an aggregate of approximately 7.6 million shares of our Class A common stock were exchanged. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have an exercise price of $308.57 per share, the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 6, 2009. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have a new vesting schedule determined by adding 12 months to each vesting date under the exchanged options’ original vesting schedule. In addition, new options will vest no sooner than six months after the date of the Exchange. The Exchange resulted in a modification charge of approximately $360 million which is being recognized over the vesting periods of the new options. These vesting periods range from six months to five years. We recorded approximately $103 million of the modification charge in 2009.\nAs of December 31, 2009, there was $1,088.0 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding employee stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.1 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs and restricted shares for the year ended December 31, 2009:\n(1) RSUs and restricted shares expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nAs of December 31, 2009, there was $1,842.7 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to employee unvested RSUs and restricted shares. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nNote 13. 401(k) Plan\nWe have a 401(k) Savings Plan (401(k) Plan) that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 60% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Employee and our contributions are fully vested when contributed. We contributed approximately $51.1 million, $72.6 million, and $82.5 million during 2007, 2008, and 2009.\nNote 14. Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes included income from foreign operations of $2,466.9 million, $3,793.7 million, and $4,802.1 million for 2007, 2008, and 2009.\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):\nThe reconciliation of federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows (in thousands):\nWe have not provided U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nany foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of December 31, 2009, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $12.3 billion. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.\nDeferred Tax Assets\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2009, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $187.8 million and $97.6 million. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2011. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.09 billion related primarily to our investments in AOL and Clearwire. For income tax purposes, the impairment will generate an equal amount of capital loss when recognized, a portion of which was recognized in 2009. As of December 31, 2009, our federal and state capital loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $776.0 million and $961.6 million. If not utilized, the federal capital losses will begin to expire in 2014. We believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the capital loss carryforwards will not be realized. Therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance on both our federal and state capital loss carryforwards in the amount of $326.2 million. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2009 (in thousands):\nOur total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $283.5 million, $561.3 million, and $814.4 million as of December 31, 2007, December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2009.\nAs of December 31, 2009, we had accrued $100.0 million for payment of interest and penalties. Interest and penalties included in our provision for income taxes was not material in all the periods presented.\nWe and our subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. Although we file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns, our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and Ireland. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) completed its examination of our 2003 and 2004 tax years. We have filed an appeal with the IRS for certain issues related to this audit, but we believe we have adequately provided for these items and any adverse results would have an immaterial impact on our unrecognized tax benefit balance within the next 12 months. The IRS commenced its examination of our 2005 and 2006 tax years in early 2008. We do not expect the examination to be completed within the next 12 months, therefore we do not anticipate any significant impact to our unrecognized tax benefit balance in 2009, related to our 2005 and 2006 tax years.\nOur 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes, and our 2002 through 2009 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are various other on-going audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\nNote 15. Information about Geographic Areas\nOur chief operating decision-makers (i.e., chief executive officer, certain of his direct reports, and our founders) review financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. There are no segment managers who are held accountable by our chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for operations, operating results, and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we consider ourselves to be in a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\nRevenues by geography are based on the billing address of the advertiser.

         "ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.\nBased on management’s evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n(b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.\nWe regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2009 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n(c) Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2009. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

         "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nGoogle is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. We aspire to build products that improve the lives of billions of people globally. Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our innovations in web search and advertising have made our website a top internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in the world.\nWe generate revenue primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising. Businesses use our AdWords program to promote their products and services with targeted advertising. In addition, the third parties that comprise the Google Network use our AdSense program to deliver relevant ads that generate revenue and enhance the user experience.\nWe were incorporated in California in September 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware in August 2003. Our headquarters are located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, and our telephone number is (650) 253-0000. We completed our initial public offering in August 2004 and our Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG.”\nCorporate Highlights\nEffective April 4, 2011, Larry Page, our Co-Founder and President, Products, will become our Chief Executive Officer, Eric E. Schmidt, our current Chief Executive Officer, will continue as the chairman of our board of directors and will serve as our Executive Chairman, and Sergey Brin, our Co-Founder and President, Technology, will continue as Co-Founder.\nIn 2010, we continued to reap the rewards of the growth of the digital economy. The shift of consumers and advertisers from offline to online continued unabated, which fueled good growth in our core business of search advertising. We continued to invest heavily, and rapidly innovate in our search technologies to expand the comprehensiveness of our index, the relevance of our results, and the speed with which we deliver search results. Some recent notable enhancements to search include Google Instant, Instant Previews, and Place Search. We believe that search will only become more intelligent, personal, and interactive, delivering the information most relevant to users, in their language, and relevant to their location and interests.\nIn addition, in the past year we have also invested aggressively in our newer businesses-namely display, mobile, and enterprise-to lay the groundwork for future growth. We have also made strategic investments in critical product areas, like Android, Chrome, and Chrome OS-following our core philosophy of building open platforms with optionality, and creating infrastructure that allows everyone on the web to succeed. We also believe that an active acquisition program is an important element of our business strategy. During 2010, we invested $1.8 billion to acquire companies, products, services, and technologies.\nOur business is primarily focused around the following key areas: search, advertising, operating systems and platforms, and enterprise.\nSearch\nWe maintain a vast index of websites and other online content, and make it available through our search engine to anyone with an internet connection. Our search technologies sort through an ever-growing amount of information to deliver relevant and useful search results in response to user queries. We integrate innovative features into our search service and offer specialized search services to help users tailor their search. In addition, we are constantly improving and adding to our products and services, to provide users with more relevant results so that users find what they are looking for faster.\nAdvertising\nGoogle Search. The goal of AdWords, our primary auction-based advertising program, is to deliver ads that are so useful and relevant to search queries or web content that they are a form of information in their own right. With AdWords, advertisers create simple text-based ads that then appear beside related search results or web content on our websites and on thousands of partner websites in our Google Network, which is the network of third parties that use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads with their search results and content. Most of our AdWords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our websites and our Google Network members’ websites as specified by the advertiser.\nOur AdSense program enables websites that are part of the Google Network to deliver ads from our AdWords advertisers that are relevant to the search results or content on their websites. We share the majority of the revenues generated from these ads with the Google Network members that display the ads. The AdSense program enables advertisers to extend the reach of their ad campaigns, improves our partners’ ability to generate revenue from their content, and delivers relevant ads for their users.\nGoogle Display. Display advertising comprises the videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets. The Google Display Network provides advertisers services related to the delivery of display advertising across publishers participating in our AdSense program, publishers participating in the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, and Google-owned sites such as YouTube and Google Finance.\nThrough our DoubleClick advertising technology, we provide to publishers, agencies, and advertisers the ad serving technology, which is the infrastructure that enables billions of ads to be served each day across the web. Our DoubleClick Ad Exchange creates a real-time auction marketplace for the trading of display ad space. We aim to simplify display advertising so it is easier for advertisers and publishers to manage campaigns across different formats, on different websites, and for different devices.\nIn addition, YouTube provides a range of video, interactive, and other ad formats for advertisers to reach their intended audience. YouTube’s video advertising solutions give advertisers a way to promote their content to the YouTube community, as well as to associate with content being watched by their target audience. YouTube also offers analytic tools to help advertisers understand their audience and derive general business intelligence. In the past year, YouTube has experienced strong growth in mobile viewers and has established key partnerships with content companies to help monetize mobile video.\nGoogle Mobile. Mobile advertising is still in relative infancy, though the mobile device is quickly becoming the world’s newest gateway to information. Google is focused on developing easy to use ad products to help advertisers extend their reach, help create revenue opportunities for our publisher partners, and deliver relevant and useful ads to users on the go.\nGoogle Mobile extends our products and services by providing mobile-specific features to mobile device users. Our mobile-specific search technologies include search by voice, search by sight, and search by location. Google Mobile also optimizes a large number of Google’s applications for mobile devices in both browser and downloadable form. In addition, we offer advertisers the ability to run search ad campaigns on mobile devices with popular mobile-specific ad formats, such as click-to-call ads in which advertisers can include a phone number within ad text. In 2010, we acquired AdMob, Inc. (AdMob), which offers effective ad units and solutions for application developers and advertisers. We continue to invest in improving users’ access to Google services through their mobile devices.\nGoogle Local. Consumers are changing the way they look for local information on the web, and Google is committed to providing users relevant local information. Our products and services also help local business owners\nmanage their presence on the web and grow their services. We are organizing information around real-world places, and any business can use Google Places to add a new listing or edit an existing one. These listings appear for free when potential customers search for products, services, and businesses on www.google.com or Google Maps. Claiming a business listing ensures that people can quickly and easily receive the most accurate and current information about a business, such as location, phone number, and hours of operation. Business owners can also edit and check their information at any time to find out how many people have seen or clicked on their free listing. Because the ability to target advertising to a specific region is a key part of building a local business, in addition to local targeting through AdWords, we offer Google Tags, a simple flat-fee advertising program for business owners to highlight their listings with details on their key differentiators. Thousands of business owners are using tag types such as coupons, custom messages, photos, and videos to make their listings stand out. In addition, by using Google Boost, a quick and easy way to participate in the ads auction, small businesses can let Google manage their advertising campaigns on the web.\nOperating Systems and Platforms\nAndroid. Working closely with the Open Handset Alliance, a business alliance of more than 75 technology and mobile companies, we developed Android, a free, fully open source mobile software platform that any developer can use to create applications for mobile devices and any handset manufacturer can install on a device. We believe Android will drive greater innovation and choice in the mobile device ecosystem, and provide consumers with a more powerful mobile experience.\nGoogle Chrome OS and Google Chrome. Google Chrome OS is an open source operating system with the Google Chrome web browser as its foundation. Both the Google Chrome OS and the Google Chrome browser are built around the core tenets of speed, simplicity, and security. Designed for people who spend most of their time on the web, the Google Chrome OS is a new approach to operating systems. We are working with several original equipment manufacturers to bring computers running Google Chrome OS to users and businesses. The Chrome browser runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux computers.\nGoogle TV. Google TV is a platform that gives consumers the power to experience television and the internet on a single screen, with the ability to search and find the content they want to watch. The Google TV platform is based on the Android operating system and runs the Google Chrome browser.\nGoogle Books. The Google Books platform (including reading applications, an electronic bookstore (eBookstore), book search, and personal library management) is designed to help people discover, search, and consume content from printed books online. Through the Google eBookstore, we make available for sale popular books in electronic book format to complement our large collection of free public domain books.\nEnterprise\nGoogle’s enterprise products provide familiar, easy-to-use Google technology for business settings. Through Google Apps, which includes Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendar, and Google Sites, among other features, we provide hosted, web-based applications that people can use on any device with a browser and an internet connection. In addition, we provide our search technology for use within enterprises through the Google Search Appliance (real-time search of business applications, intranet applications, and public websites), on their public-facing sites with Google Site Search (custom search engine), and Google Commerce Search (for online retail enterprises). We also offer Google Checkout, a service for our users, merchants, and advertisers to make online shopping and payments more streamlined and secure. We also provide versions of our Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API) for businesses (including fully interactive Google Maps for public and internal websites), as well as Google Earth Enterprise (a behind-the-company-firewall software solution for imagery and data visualization). Our enterprise solutions have been adopted by a variety of businesses, governments, schools, and non-profit organizations. Google Apps is the first cloud computing suite of message and collaboration tools to receive U.S. government security certification.\nResearch\nWe continue to develop new products and services and to enhance our existing ones through research and product development and the licensing and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Our product development philosophy is to launch innovative products early and often, and then iterate rapidly to make those products even better. We often post early stage products on Google Labs, at test locations online, or directly on Google.com. We then use data and user feedback to decide if and how to invest further in those products.\nOur research and development expenses were $2.8 billion, $2.8 billion, and $3.8 billion in 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively, which included stock-based compensation expense of $732 million, $725 million, and $861 million, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in building the employee and systems infrastructures needed to support the development of new products and services and to improve existing ones.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. Over time, we have assembled a portfolio of patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, and trade secrets covering our products and services. Our proprietary technology is not dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. Although we rigorously protect our proprietary technology, any significant impairment of, or third-party claim against, our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.\nSales and Support\nWe continue to develop and grow our sales and support infrastructure. We have over 85 offices in over 40 countries, the large majority of which include sales people. Our global sales and support infrastructure has specialized teams across vertical markets. We bring businesses into our advertising network through direct, remote, and online sales channels, using technology and automation wherever possible to improve our customers' experience and to grow our business cost-effectively. Our direct advertising and sales teams focus on building relationships with the largest advertisers and leading internet companies. In 2010, we invested in building a multi-product sales force, with teams selling campaigns that include search, display (including DoubleClick and YouTube), and mobile advertising.\nWe provide customer service to our advertiser base through our global support organization. Our global support organization concentrates on helping our advertisers and Google Network members get the most out of their relationship with us.\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2008, 2009, or 2010.\nGovernment Contracts\nNo material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.\nMarketing\nGoogle’s global brand is well known. We believe that building a trusted, highly-recognized brand begins with providing high-quality products and services that make a notable difference in people’s lives. Marketing is responsible for generating advertiser revenue through marketing campaigns to small businesses, as well as providing thought leadership to chief marketing officers through industry insight, research, and analysis. Our marketing, promotional, and public relations activities are designed to promote Google’s brand image and differentiate it from competitors.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change and converging, as well as new and disruptive, technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with information on the web and provide them with relevant advertising. We face competition from:\n•\nGeneral purpose search engines, such as Yahoo and Microsoft’s Bing.\n•\nVertical search engines and e-commerce websites, such as Kayak (travel queries), Monster.com (job queries), WebMD (for health queries), and Amazon.com and eBay (e-commerce). Some users will navigate directly to such websites rather than go through Google.\n•\nSocial networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. Some users are relying more on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through general purpose search engines.\n•\nOther forms of advertising, such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, and yellow pages, for ad dollars. Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n•\nCommercial software companies, such as Microsoft and Apple, and mobile applications. Users are increasingly accessing e-commerce and other sites through stand-alone mobile applications embedded in the operating system of the device, instead of through search engines.\n•\nProviders of online products and services. A number of our online products and services, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs, compete directly with new and established companies, which offer communication, information, and entertainment services integrated into their products or media properties.\nWe compete to attract and retain users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, primarily on the basis of the relevance and usefulness of our search results and the features, availability, and ease of use of our products and services.\nWe also compete to attract and retain content providers (Google Network members, as well as other content providers for whom we distribute or license content), primarily based on the size and quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a number of domestic and foreign laws and regulations. New laws or new interpretations of existing laws will also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws may increase in the future and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.\nCulture and Employees\nWe take great pride in our culture. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex technical challenges. Transparency and open dialog are central to us, and we like to ensure that company news reaches our employees first through internal channels.\nDespite our rapid growth, we still cherish our roots as a startup and give employees the freedom to act on their ideas regardless of role or function within the company. We strive to hire the best employees, with backgrounds and perspectives as diverse as our global users. We provide an environment where these talented people can have fulfilling careers working on some of the biggest challenges in technology, and have a huge, positive impact on the world.\nAt December 31, 2010, we had 24,400 full-time employees, consisting of 9,508 in research and development, 8,778 in sales and marketing, 3,346 in general and administrative, and 2,768 in operations. All of Google’s employees are also equityholders, with significant collective employee ownership. Although we have workers’ councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our employees are not represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff.\nGlobal Operations and Geographic Data\nWe provide our products and services in more than 100 languages and in more than 50 countries, regions, and territories. On www.google.com or one of our other Google domains, users can find information in many different languages and in many different formats. The United States accounted for approximately 48% of our revenues in 2010. Information regarding financial data by geographic areas is set forth in Item 7 and Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.google.com, and our investor relations website is located at http://investor.google.com. The following filings are available through our investor relations website after we file them with the SEC: Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our Proxy Statements for our annual meetings of stockholders, for the last three years. These filings are also available for download free of charge on our investor relations website. We also provide a link to the section of the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov that has all of our public filings, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, all amendments to those reports, our Proxy Statements, and other ownership related filings. Further, a copy of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is located at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room can be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.\nWe webcast our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host with members of the investment community on our investor relations website. Additionally, we provide notifications of news or announcements regarding our financial performance, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs as part of our investor relations website. Investors and others can receive notifications of new information posted on our investor relations website in real time by signing up for email alerts and RSS feeds. Further corporate governance information, including our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines, board committee charters, and code of conduct, is also available on our investor relations website under the heading “Corporate Governance.” The contents of our websites are not intended to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.",
         "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe face intense competition.\nOur business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and is subject to changing technology, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. We have many competitors in different industries, including general purpose search engines, vertical search engines and e-commerce sites, social networking sites, traditional media companies, and providers of online products and services. Our current and potential competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Established companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users, and they can use their experience and resources against us in a variety of competitive ways, including by making acquisitions, investing aggressively in research and development, and competing aggressively for advertisers and websites. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, and content providers, our revenues and growth rates could decline.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could suffer.\nOur success depends on providing products and services that make using the internet a more useful and enjoyable experience for our users. Our competitors are constantly developing innovations in web search, online advertising, and web-based products and services. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development in order to enhance our web search technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. If we are unable to provide quality products and services, then our users may become dissatisfied and move to a competitor’s products and services. In addition, these new products and services may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if users of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, and Google Network members, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities, or are not effectively brought to market. As search technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer search results that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive.\nOur ongoing investment in new business strategies and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our ongoing businesses.\nWe have invested, and in the future may invest, in new business strategies, and new products, services, and technologies. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe generate our revenues almost entirely from advertising, and the reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could seriously harm our business.\nWe generated 96% of our revenues in 2010 from our advertisers. Our advertisers can generally terminate their contracts with us at any time. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in\nadvertising with us does not generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, or if we do not deliver their advertisements in an appropriate and effective manner. In addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. If we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertisers, they may stop placing ads with us, which would negatively harm our revenues and business.\nWe expect our revenue growth rate to decline and anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\nWe believe our revenue growth rate will generally decline as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, the inevitable decline in growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels, and the increasing maturity of the online advertising market. We believe our operating margin will experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for many aspects of our business. Our operating margin will also experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our Google Network members’ websites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on our own websites or if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote the distribution of certain products, including Google Chrome. The margin on revenues we generate from our Google Network members is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites. Additionally, the margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google Network members.\nWe are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business.\nThe growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields implicate a variety of new regulatory issues and may subject us to increased regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. Legislators and regulators, including those currently conducting investigations in the U.S. and Europe, may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users, require us to incur substantial costs, or change our business practices. These changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property claims, competition and antitrust matters, privacy matters, tax matters, labor and employment claims, commercial claims, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. In addition, it is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in our business practices, or requiring development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could in the future materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, Google Network members, and other partners.\nThe brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the “Google” brand is critical to expanding our base of users, advertisers, Google Network members, and other partners. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the internet market. Our brand may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including data privacy and security issues, service outages, and product malfunctions. If we fail to maintain\nand enhance the “Google” brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality products and services, which we may not do successfully.\nAcquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and we expect our current pace of acquisitions to continue. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:\n•\nDiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges.\n•\nImplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.\n•\nIntegration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions.\n•\nTransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.\n•\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire.\n•\nLiability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.\n•\nLitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\n•\nIn the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\n•\nFailure to successfully further develop the acquired technology.\n•\nFailure to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if it all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\nFuture acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.\nA variety of new and existing U.S. and foreign laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws in the U.S. and abroad that are costly to comply with, can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort, and can subject us to claims or other remedies. Many of\nthese laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies. The laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. For example, the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the U.S. and abroad. Claims have been threatened and filed under both U.S. and foreign laws for defamation, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, copyright and trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users, our products and services, or content generated by our users.\nIn addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for hosting, or for listing or linking to, third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California’s Information Practices Act. We face similar risks and costs as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services.\nFrom time to time, concerns have been expressed about whether our products and services compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result, and has resulted, in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, as nearly all of our products and services are web based, the amount of data we store for our users on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users’ data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We may also need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based products and services we offer, and operate in more countries.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of users’ and customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential\nliability. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers.\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property or other claims, which are costly to defend, could result in significant damage awards, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nInternet, technology, and media companies own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As we have grown, the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies.\nWe have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies, including Android, Google WebSearch, Google AdWords, Google AdSense, Google News, Google Image Search, Google Chrome, Google Talk, Google Voice, and YouTube, infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also result in a change in our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.\nIn addition, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Furthermore, such customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.\nRegardless of the merits of the claims, intellectual property claims are often time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and cause significant diversion of management attention. To the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful, they may have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flow.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective.\nAlthough we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, because of our long-term interests in open source, we may not have\nadequate patent protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.\nWe also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date, and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this section and the following factors may affect our operating results:\n•\nOur ability to continue to attract users to our websites and satisfy existing users on our websites.\n•\nOur ability to monetize (or generate revenues from) traffic on our websites and our Google Network members’ websites.\n•\nOur ability to attract advertisers to our AdWords program, and our ability to attract websites to our AdSense program.\n•\nThe mix in our revenues between those generated on our websites and those generated through our Google Network.\n•\nThe amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and our ability to manage the resulting risk through our foreign exchange risk management program.\n•\nThe amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure.\n•\nOur focus on long-term goals over short-term results.\n•\nThe results of our investments in risky projects, including new business strategies and new products, services, and technologies.\n•\nOur ability to keep our websites operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions.\n•\nOur ability to generate significant revenues from services in which we have invested considerable time and resources, such as Google Checkout.\nBecause our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results. In addition, advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature,\nreflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. Also, user traffic tends to be seasonal. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.\nMore individuals are using devices other than personal computers to access the internet. If users of these devices do not widely adopt versions of our web search technology, products, or operating systems developed for these devices, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones, smart phones, handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets, video game consoles, and television set-top devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years. The lower resolution, functionality, and memory associated with some alternative devices make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users, manufacturers, or distributors of alternative devices. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. We have limited experience to date in operating versions of our products and services developed or optimized for users of alternative devices, such as Google Mobile and Android, or in designing alternative devices. As new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such devices. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, distributors, and users to our products and services, or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices, we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services, which could adversely affect our business.\nWeb spam and content farms could decrease our search quality, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\n“Web spam” refers to websites that attempt to violate a search engine’s quality guidelines or that otherwise seek to rank higher in search results than a search engine’s assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Although English-language web spam in our search results is less than half of what it was five years ago, and web spam in most other languages is even lower than in English, we have nonetheless seen an increase in web spam in recent months. As part of our efforts to combat web spam, we recently launched new indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We have also improved our ability to detect hacked websites, which were a major source of web spam in 2010. We face new challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including “content farms,” which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. In 2010, we launched two algorithmic changes focused on low-quality websites. If web spam and content farms continue to increase on Google, this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce user traffic to our websites. In addition, as we continue to take actions to improve our search quality and reduce low-quality content, this may in the short run reduce our AdSense revenues, since some of these websites are AdSense partners.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts\nof vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services, or damage to or failure of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services, which could reduce our revenues and profits, and damage our brand.\nOur business and operations are experiencing rapid growth. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational, and financial infrastructure. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our products and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and operating results. Our expansion and growth in international markets heighten these risks as a result of the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute resolution systems, regulatory systems, and commercial infrastructures. To effectively manage this growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and compliance procedures. These systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our financial position.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to further expand internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 52% of our total revenues in 2010, and more than half of our user traffic has been coming from outside the U.S. In certain international markets, we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to additional risks, including the following:\n•\nChanges in local political, economic, social, and labor conditions, which may adversely harm our business.\n•\nRestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.\n•\nImport and export requirements that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market and may increase our operating costs.\n•\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to manage these fluctuations through our foreign exchange risk management program.\n•\nLonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.\n•\nUncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent.\n•\nDifferent employee/employer relationships, existence of workers’ councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\nIn addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting\ncorrupt payments to governmental officials, and anti-competition regulations, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nFurthermore, since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net income. Additionally, hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we were to lose the services of Larry, Sergey, Eric, or other members of our senior management team, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In particular, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric E. Schmidt are critical to the overall management of Google, as well as the development of our technology, our culture, and our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of any of our management or key personnel could seriously harm our business.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. Such interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth.\nNew technologies could block our ads, which would harm our business.\nTechnologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of our advertising products. Most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages for our users. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.\nAlthough we have not recognized any significant losses to date on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, any significant future declines in the market values of our marketable securities could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. Given the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally. Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, and accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price for our Class A common stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example, in 2010, the price of our Class A common stock ranged from $433.63 per share to $630.85 per share. The trading price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n•\nQuarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors.\n•\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments.\n•\nRecommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.\n•\nAnnouncements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance on earnings.\n•\nAnnouncements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.\n•\nThe volume of shares of Class A common stock available for public sale.\n•\nSales of stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by our directors, executive officers, and other employees).\n•\nShort sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Class A common stock (including derivative transactions under our transferable stock option program).\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a company’s securities, securities class-action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs, and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of January 31, 2011, Larry, Sergey, and Eric owned approximately 91% of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing approximately 67% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Larry, Sergey, and Eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. This concentrated control limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class common stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry, Sergey, and Eric have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\n•\nOur board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.\n•\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders’ meeting.\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n•\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n•\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.",

         "ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOur Class A common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since August 19, 2004. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our stock. The following table sets forth for the indicated periods the high and low sales prices per share for our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nOur Class B common stock is neither listed nor traded.\nHolders of Record\nAs of January 31, 2011, there were approximately 3,074 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock, and the closing price of our Class A common stock was $600.36 per share as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. As of January 31, 2011, there were approximately 88 stockholders of record of our Class B common stock.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nStock Performance Graph\nThis performance graph shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference into any filing of Google under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.\nThe following graph shows a comparison from December 31, 2005 through December 31, 2010 of the cumulative total return for our Class A common stock, the S&P 500 Index, the Nasdaq Composite Index, and the RDG Internet Composite Index.

         "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nGoogle is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. Our innovations in web search and advertising have made our website a top internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. We serve three primary constituencies:\n•\nUsers. We provide users with products and services that enable people to more quickly and easily find, create, and organize information that is useful to them.\n•\nAdvertisers. We provide advertisers with cost-effective ways to deliver online ads, as well as offline ads on television, to customers across Google-owned websites and through the Google Network, which is the network of third parties that use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads with their search results and content.\n•\nGoogle Network Members and Other Content Providers. We provide the members of our Google Network with our Google AdSense programs. These include programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on the websites of our Google Network members, as well as programs to deliver ads on television broadcasts. We share most of the fees these ads generate with our Google Network members, thereby creating an important revenue stream for them. In addition, we have entered into arrangements with other content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content, and we may display ads next to or as part of this content on the pages of our websites and our Google Network members’ websites. We share most of the fees these ads generate with these content providers and our Google Network members, thereby creating an important revenue stream for these partners.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nAdvertising revenues made up 97% of our revenues in 2008 and 2009, and 96% of our revenues in 2010. We derive most of our additional revenues from offering display advertising management services to advertisers, ad agencies, and publishers, as well as licensing our enterprise products, search solutions, and web search technology.\nGoogle AdWords is our auction-based advertising program that enables advertisers to place text-based and display ads on our websites and our Google Network members’ websites. Display advertising comprises the videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets. Most of our AdWords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our websites and our Google Network members’ websites as specified by the advertiser. For advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-click pricing, we recognize as revenue the fees charged to advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results or content on our websites or our Google Network members’ websites. For advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-impression pricing, we recognize as revenue the fees charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on our websites or our Google Network members’ websites. Our AdWords agreements are generally terminable at any time by our advertisers.\nGoogle AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on the websites of our Google Network members, as well as programs to deliver ads on television. Our AdSense programs include AdSense for search and AdSense for content.\nAdSense for search is our online service for distributing relevant ads from our advertisers for display with search results on our Google Network members’ websites. To use AdSense for search, most of our AdSense for search partners add Google search functionality to their web pages in the form of customizable Google search boxes. When visitors of these websites search either the website or the internet using these customizable search boxes, we display relevant ads on the search results pages, targeted to match user search queries. Ads shown through AdSense for search are text ads.\nAdSense for content is our online service for distributing ads from our advertisers that are relevant to content on our Google Network members’ websites. Under this program, we use automated technology to analyze the meaning of the content on the web page and serve relevant ads based on the meaning of such content. For example, a web page on an automotive blog that contains an entry about vintage cars might display ads for vintage car parts or vintage car shows. These ads are displayed in spaces that our AdSense for content partners have set aside on their websites. AdSense for content allows a variety of ad types to be shown, including text ads, image ads, Google Video Ads, link units (which are sets of clickable links to topic pages related to page content), themed units (which are regular text ads with graphic treatments that change seasonally and by geography), and gadget ads (which are customized “mini-sites” that run as ads on AdSense publisher websites).\nFor our online AdSense program, our advertisers pay us a fee each time a user clicks on one of our advertisers’ ads displayed on our Google Network members’ websites or, for those advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression pricing, as their ads are displayed. To date, we have paid most of these advertiser fees to our Google Network members, and we expect to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. We recognize these advertiser fees as revenue and the portion of the advertiser fee we pay to our Google Network members as traffic acquisition costs under cost of revenues. Google Network members do not pay any fees associated with the use of our AdSense program on their websites.\nOur agreements with Google Network members consist largely of uniform online “click-wrap” agreements that members enter into by interacting with our registration websites. The standard agreements have no stated term and are terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both the standard agreements and the negotiated agreements require us to share with the Google Network member most of the advertiser fees generated by users clicking on ads on the Google Network member’s website or, for advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression pricing, as the ads are displayed on the Google Network member’s website. For example, under our standard agreements, we pay 51% and 68% of the fees collected from advertisers to our Google Network members in AdSense for search and AdSense for content, respectively.\nGoogle ads for televisions enable advertisers, operators, and programmers to buy, schedule, deliver, and measure ads on television. We recognize as revenue the fees charged to advertisers each time an ad is displayed on television in accordance with the related agreements.\nWe also offer display advertising management services such as media planning, buying, implementation, and measurement tools for advertisers and agencies, and forecasting and reporting tools for publishers. We recognize the related fees as other revenues in the period advertising impressions are delivered.\nIn January 2010, we launched, and in July 2010, we discontinued, our direct-to-consumer web store channel of distributing our Nexus One mobile phone. We had recognized fees derived from the sale of these phones as other revenues in the period in which they were delivered. We do not expect to recognize any additional revenue associated with the sale of these phones in the future.\nWe have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. Our agreements with content providers are typically standard agreements with no stated term and are terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both the standard agreements and the negotiated agreements require us to pay the content providers for the content we license. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our websites and our Google Network members’ websites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers and Google Network members. We recognize these advertiser fees as revenue. We recognize the portion of the advertiser fees we pay to our content providers as content acquisition costs under cost of revenues and the portion we pay to our Google Network members as traffic acquisition costs.\nWe believe the factors that influence the success of our advertising programs include the following:\n•\nThe relevance, objectivity, and quality of our search results and the relevance and quality of ads displayed with each search results page.\n•\nThe number of searches initiated at our websites and our Google Network members’ websites and the underlying purpose of these searches (for instance, whether they are for academic research, to find a news article, or to find a product or service).\n•\nThe number and prominence of ads displayed on our websites and our Google Network members’ websites.\n•\nThe number of visits to, and the content of, our Google Network members’ websites and certain of our websites and the relevance and quality of the ads we display next to this content.\n•\nThe advertisers’ return on investment from advertising campaigns on our websites or our Google Network members’ websites compared to other forms of advertising.\n•\nThe total advertising spending budgets of each advertiser.\n•\nThe number of advertisers and the breadth of items advertised.\n•\nThe amount we ultimately pay our Google Network members, distribution partners, and our content providers for traffic, access points, and content, compared to the amount of revenues we generate.\n•\nOur ability to increase searches on our websites and our Google Network members’ websites via new ad formats on devices other than personal computers, including mobile devices.\nTrends in Our Business\nAdvertising transactions continue to shift from offline to online as the digital economy evolves. This has contributed to the rapid growth of our business since inception, resulting in substantially increased revenues, and we expect that our business will continue to grow. However, our revenue growth rate has generally declined over time, and we expect it will continue to do so as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, the difficulty of maintaining growth rates as our revenues increase to higher levels, and increasing maturity of the online advertising market. In addition, we plan to continue to invest aggressively in our core areas of strategic focus.\nThe main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to our users, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and our Google Network members’ websites. These steps include not displaying ads that generate low click-through rates or that send users to irrelevant or otherwise low quality websites, and terminating our relationships with those Google Network members whose websites do not meet our quality requirements. We may also continue to take steps to reduce the number of accidental clicks by our users. These steps could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues.\nBoth seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenues, as well as aggregate paid click and average cost-per-click growth rates.\nThe operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our Google Network members’ websites through our AdSense program is significantly lower than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from ads placed on our websites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on Google Network members’ websites are shared with our Google Network members. For the past five years, growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from our Google Network members’ websites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future, although the relative rate of growth in revenues from our websites compared to the rate of growth in revenues from our Google Network members’ websites may vary over time.\nWe also continue to invest aggressively in our systems, data centers, corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure, and employees. We expect to increase our hiring in 2011 and provide competitive compensation programs for our employees. For instance, effective January 1, 2011, we increased base salaries for all of our non-executive employees by 10%, as well as shifted a portion of the bonus into base salary. Our full-time employee headcount was 19,835 at December 31, 2009 and 24,400 at December 31, 2010. Acquisitions will also remain an important component of our strategy and use of capital, and we expect our current pace of acquisitions to continue. We expect our cost of revenues will increase in dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, credit card and other transaction fees, content acquisition costs, and other costs. In particular, traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may increase in the future if we are unable to continue to improve the monetization or generation of revenues from traffic on our websites and our Google Network members’ websites.\nAs we expand our advertising programs and other products to international markets, we continue to increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates. For example, in 2010, the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) had an unfavorable impact on our revenues as compared to 2009. We have a foreign exchange risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. However, this program will not fully offset the effect of fluctuations on our revenues and earnings.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our historical operating results as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated:\nRevenues\nThe following table presents our revenues, by revenue source, for the periods presented (in millions):\nThe following table presents our revenues, by revenue source, as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented:\nThe increase in our revenues from 2009 to 2010 resulted primarily from an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google websites and Google Network members’ websites and, to a lesser extent, an increase in other\nrevenues, largely as a result of the launch of our mobile phone business in the first quarter of 2010. The increase in advertising revenue for Google websites and Google Network members’ websites from 2009 to 2010 resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic, certain monetization improvements, including new ad formats, and the continued global expansion of our products, and our advertiser and user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network members. The increase in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was primarily driven by the increased spending from advertisers, partially offset by the changes in geographical mix due to traffic growth in emerging markets, where the average cost-per-click is typically lower, compared to more mature markets.\nGrowth in our revenues from 2008 to 2009 resulted primarily from growth in advertising revenues generated by Google websites, and to a lesser extent, Google Network members’ websites. Our advertising revenue growth for Google websites and Google Network members’ websites resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs, partially offset by a decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. In addition, the growth in advertising revenues benefited from more hedging gains recognized under our foreign exchange risk management program. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic, certain monetization improvements, and the continued global expansion of our products, advertiser base, and user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network members. The decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was primarily the result of the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies (principally the British pound and the Euro), as well as changes in geographical mix due to traffic growth in emerging markets, where the average cost-per-click is typically lower, compared to more mature markets. In addition, the decrease in the average cost-per-click was due to changes in how we believe advertisers managed their advertising costs in response to the uncertain economic conditions in 2008 and 2009. Specifically, we believe that, as a result of the economic downturn and the economic uncertainty, advertisers, in aggregate, lowered their bids for keywords in response to a decrease in sales they were able to make per paid click.\nImprovements in our ability to ultimately monetize increased traffic primarily relate to enhancing the user experience, including moving the search result URL (uniform resource locator) to a separate line to improve users’ readability, providing users with ads that are more relevant to their search queries or to the content on the Google Network members’ websites they visit. For instance, these improvements include enabling previously promoted high quality ads to be shown on subsequent pages, adding merchant ratings information to improve users’ ability to evaluate ads, providing users with multiple ad site links for certain web search ad results, reducing the minimum cost-per-click which results in the display of more relevant ads, and changing the clickable area around our AdSense for content text-based ads to only the title and URL to reduce the number of accidental clicks.\nAggregate paid clicks on Google websites and Google Network members’ websites increased approximately 16% from 2009 to 2010 and approximately 15% from 2008 to 2009. Average cost-per-click on Google websites and Google Network members’ websites increased approximately 5% from 2009 to 2010 and decreased approximately 7% from 2008 to 2009. The rate of change in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click, and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors including the revenue growth rates on our websites compared to those of our Google Network members, advertiser competition for keywords, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, seasonality, the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs, and general economic conditions. In addition, traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals also contributes to these fluctuations. Changes in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click may not be indicative of our performance or advertiser experiences in any specific geographic market, vertical, or industry.\nWe believe that the increase in the number of paid clicks on Google websites and Google Network members’ websites is substantially the result of our commitment to improving the relevance and quality of both our search\nresults and the advertisements displayed, which we believe results in a better user experience, which in turn results in more searches, advertisers, and Google Network members and other partners.\nRevenues by Geography\nThe following table presents our domestic and international revenues as a percentage of consolidated revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our customers:\nThe growth in international revenues (other than the United Kingdom) as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2009 to 2010 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs and our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products for these international markets. The growth in revenues from the United States as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2009 to 2010 resulted largely from the recovery of certain key verticals such as retail, travel, finance, and insurance. The decline in revenues from the United Kingdom as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2009 to 2010 resulted primarily from a less robust economic recovery relative to the United States and the rest of world, as well as a decrease in hedging gains recognized during 2010.\nThe growth in international revenues (other than the United Kingdom) as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2008 to 2009 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs and our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products for these international markets, partially offset by the net effect of the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) and the related hedging gains. The decrease in revenues from the United Kingdom as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2008 to 2009 resulted largely from the effect of the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the British pound, partially offset by more hedging gains realized from our foreign exchange risk management program in 2009 as compared to 2008.\nThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) from 2009 to 2010 had an unfavorable impact on our international revenues. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our revenues from the United Kingdom would have been approximately $10 million, or 0.3% higher, and our revenues from the rest of the world would have been approximately $25 million, or 0.2% higher in 2010. This is before consideration of hedging gains of $42 million and $161 million recognized to revenues from the United Kingdom and the rest of the world in 2010.\nThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the British pound and the Euro) from 2008 to 2009 had an unfavorable impact on our international revenues. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our revenues from United Kingdom would have been approximately $543 million, or 18.2% higher, and our revenues from the rest of the world would have been approximately $484 million, or 5.1% higher in 2009. This is before consideration of hedging gains of $182 million and $143 million recognized to revenues from the United Kingdom and the rest of the world in 2009.\nAlthough we expect to continue to make investments in international markets, these investments may not result in an increase in our international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2011 or thereafter. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about geographic areas.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately paid to our Google Network members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search queries to our website (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share arrangements with our Google Network members and distribution partners.\nCertain distribution arrangements require us to pay our distribution partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not exclusively-or at all-based on revenue share. The fees are non-refundable. Further, these distribution arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts, we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. We recognize fees under these distribution arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points (approximately two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year, or based on any contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, we expense the fees as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenues.\nCost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy and bandwidth costs, content acquisition costs, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements we display ads on the pages of our websites and our Google Network members’ websites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers and the Google Network members.\nThe following tables present our cost of revenues and cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, and our traffic acquisition costs, and traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues, for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nCost of revenues increased $1,573 million from 2009 to 2010. The increase was primarily related to an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $897 million resulting largely from more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program. The increase was also related to an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $251 million from our distribution arrangements as a result of more traffic directed to our websites, as well as more distribution fees paid. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily due to more revenues realized from Google Network members to whom we pay less revenue share, and expiration of an AdSense arrangement under which we paid guaranteed minimum revenue share. In addition, there was an increase in content acquisition costs of $169 million primarily related to content displayed on YouTube and an increase in mobile phone costs.\nCost of revenues increased $222 million from 2008 to 2009. The increase was primarily related to an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $249 million from our distribution arrangements as a result of more distribution fees paid and more traffic directed to our websites. This was partially offset by a decrease in traffic acquisition costs of $19 million from our AdSense arrangements, primarily as a result of more revenue realized from Google Network members to whom we paid less revenue share. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of advertising revenues from our websites compared to our Google Network members’ websites, as well as more revenue realized from Google Network members to whom we paid less revenue share.\nWe expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2011 and in future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, credit card and other transaction fees, content acquisition costs, and other costs. Traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors, including the following:\n•\nThe relative growth rates of revenues from our websites and from our Google Network members’ websites.\n•\nWhether we are able to enter into more AdSense arrangements that provide for lower revenue share obligations or whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential Google Network members results in less favorable revenue share arrangements.\n•\nWhether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on our websites and our Google Network members’ websites.\n•\nThe relative growth rates of expenses associated with distribution arrangements and the related revenues generated, including whether we share with certain existing and new distribution partners proportionately more of the aggregate advertising fees that we earn from paid clicks derived from search queries these partners direct to our websites.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents our research and development expenses, and research and development expenses as a percentage of our revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel responsible for the research and development of new and existing products and services. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.\nResearch and development expenses increased $919 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor-related costs of $578 million, largely as a result of a 28% increase in research and development headcount, including headcount from acquisitions. In addition, there was an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $136 million.\nResearch and development expenses increased $50 million from 2008 to 2009. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor-related costs of $138 million, largely as a result of a 14% increase in research and development headcount, partially offset by a decrease in professional services costs of $74 million, the majority of which were related to consulting costs, and a decrease in amortization of intangible assets of $23 million as certain intangible assets have been fully amortized.\nWe expect that research and development expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2011 and future periods because we expect to continue to invest in building the necessary employee and systems infrastructures required to support the development of new, and improve existing, products and services.\nSales and Marketing\nThe following table presents our sales and marketing expenses, and sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel engaged in customer service, sales, and sales support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenditures.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $815 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expense of $387 million. In addition, there was an increase in labor-related costs of $254 million, largely as a result of a 20% increase in sales and marketing headcount, and higher commission expense.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $38 million from 2008 to 2009. This increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expense of $104 million, partially offset by a decrease in travel, conference, and related expenses of $50 million.\nWe expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2011 and future periods, as we expand our business globally, increase advertising and promotional expenditures in connection with new and existing products, and increase the level of service we provide to our advertisers, Google Network members, and other partners.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe following table presents our general and administrative expenses, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel and facilities, and include costs related to our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, and legal organizations, and fees for professional services. Professional services are principally comprised of outside legal, audit, information technology consulting, and outsourcing services.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $294 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was primarily due to increases in professional services of $137 million, the majority of which were related to legal and temporary services costs. In addition, there was an increase in labor-related costs of $64 million largely as a result of a 14% increase in general and administrative headcount, and an increase in charitable contributions of $64 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $135 million from 2008 to 2009. This decrease was primarily related to the settlement agreement with the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers (AAP) under which we recognized $95 million of expense in 2008. In addition, consulting costs decreased by $60 million.\nAs we expand our business and incur additional expenses, we expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2011 and future periods.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table presents our stock-based compensation, and stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nStock-based compensation increased $212 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was largely due to additional stock awards issued to existing and new employees.\nStock-based compensation increased $44 million from 2008 to 2009. This increase was largely due to the modification charge recognized in 2009 related to our stock option exchange program completed in March 2009, as well as additional stock awards issued to existing and new employees. This increase was partially offset by lower stock-based compensation expense as a result of a significant amount of equity awards which fully vested in 2008, as well as an increase to the overall estimated forfeiture rate.\nWe estimate stock-based compensation to be approximately $1.6 billion in 2011 and $1.9 billion thereafter. This estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after December 31, 2010 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. In addition, to the extent forfeiture rates are different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nImpairment of Equity Investments\nIn the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.1 billion, which was primarily comprised of $726 million and $355 million related to our investments in America Online, Inc. (AOL) and Clearwire Corporation (Clearwire), respectively. We sold our investment in AOL in the second quarter of 2009.\nInterest and Other Income, Net\nInterest and other income, net increased $346 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest income of $349 million due to an increase in our cash and investment balances and higher yields, as well as an increase in net realized gains on sales of marketable securities of $88 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in net foreign exchange related costs of $95 million primarily related to our foreign exchange risk management program.\nInterest and other income, net decreased $247 million from 2008 to 2009. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in interest income of $160 million due to lower yields on our cash and investment balances and an increase in net foreign exchange related costs of $88 million primarily due to more hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program.\nThe costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities that we recognized to interest and other income, net are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts, as well as the volatility of the foreign exchange rates.\nAs we expand our international business, we believe costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program may increase in dollar amount in 2011 and future periods.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for income taxes, and effective tax rate for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nOur provision for income taxes increased from 2009 to 2010, primarily as a result of increases in federal and state income taxes, driven by higher taxable income year over year. Our effective tax rate decreased from 2009 to 2010, primarily because we released certain tax reserves as a result of the settlement of our 2005 and 2006 tax audits in 2010. This decrease was partially offset by proportionately higher earnings in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nOur provision for income taxes increased from 2008 to 2009, primarily as a result of increases in federal and state income taxes, driven by higher taxable income year over year. Our effective tax rate decreased from 2008 to 2009, primarily as a result of the amount of the impairment charge of equity investments recorded in 2008 compared to the related benefit.\nOur effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates. Our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, and accounting principles. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included later in this Item 7 for additional information about our provision for income taxes.\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nYou should read the following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. You should also keep in mind that our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2010. This table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for fair presentation of our financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2010:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn summary, our cash flows are as follows (in millions):\nAt December 31, 2010, we had $35.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate securities.\nAs of December 31, 2010, $16.7 billion of the $35.0 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. At December 31, 2010, we had unused letters of credit for approximately $65 million. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. In addition, we may make acquisitions or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund any such acquisitions and licensing activities. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.\nOn July 1, 2010, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire ITA Software, Inc., a privately-held flight information software company, for $700 million in cash, subject to adjustments. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. We expect this transaction to close in the first half of 2011.\nOn July 15, 2010, we announced a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from the commercial paper program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2010, we had $3.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.3% that matures at various dates through November 2011. Average commercial paper borrowings during the quarter were $2.3 billion, and the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding during the quarter was $3.0 billion. In conjunction with this program, we established a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring on June 30, 2013. Interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2010.\nIn December 2010, we issued a secured promissory note in the amount of $468 million with an interest rate of 1.0% that matures in one year. Proceeds were used for the acquisition of an office building in New York City.\nCash provided by operating activities consisted of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including amortization, depreciation, deferred income taxes, excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities, stock-based compensation expense, and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. Cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was $11,081 million, and consisted of net income of $8,505 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $2,675 million, and cash used in working capital and other activities of $99 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,376 million of stock-based compensation expense, $1,067 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, and $329 million of amortization of intangible and other assets, partially offset by $94 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities. In addition, the decrease in cash from changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of an increase of $1,129 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers and an increase of $414 million in prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets. These increases were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $745 million, an increase in accounts payable of $272 million, an increase in accrued revenue share of $214 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $111 million, and a net increase in income tax payable and deferred income taxes of $102 million, which includes the same $94 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities included under adjustments for non-cash items. The increase in accrued expense and other liabilities, accounts payable, accrued revenue share, and deferred revenues are primarily a result of the growth in our business and headcount. The increase in net income taxes payable and deferred income taxes was primarily a result of additional tax obligations accrued, partially offset by the release of certain tax reserves as a result of the settlement of our tax audits for our 2005 and 2006 tax years.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2009 was $9,316 million, and consisted of net income of $6,520 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $2,310 million, and cash provided by working capital and other activities of $486 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,240 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, $1,164 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $284 million of amortization of intangible and other assets, partially offset by $268 million of deferred income taxes on earnings and $90 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a decrease of $262 million in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $243 million which is a direct result of the growth of our business, and a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $217 million, which includes the same $90 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities included under adjustments for non-cash items, and an increase in accrued revenue share of $158 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase of $504 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers. The increase in net income taxes payable and deferred income taxes was primarily a result of additional tax obligations accrued, partially offset by an increase in the amount of estimated income taxes we paid during the year. The increase in accrued revenue share was due to the growth in our AdSense and distribution programs and the timing of payments made to our partners.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2008 was $7,853 million, and consisted of net income of $4,227 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $3,299 million, and cash provided by working capital and other activities of $327 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,212 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, $1,120 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $1,095 million of impairment charges of equity investments, partially offset by $225 million of deferred income taxes on earnings, and $159 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $626 million, which includes the same $159 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities included under adjustments for non-cash items, and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $339 million. The increases in accrued expenses are a direct result of the growth of our business and an increase in headcount. These increases to working capital activities were partially offset by an increase of $334 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers, a decrease of $212 million in accounts payable due to the timing of invoice processing and payments and an increase of $147 million in prepaid revenue shares, expenses, and other assets.\nAs we expand our business internationally, we have offered payment terms to certain advertisers that are standard in their locales but longer than terms we would generally offer to our domestic advertisers. This may increase our working capital requirements and may have a negative effect on cash provided by our operating activities.\nCash used in investing activities in 2010 of $10,680 million was primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of $6,886 million, capital expenditures of $4,018 million of which $1.8 billion was for the purchase of an office building in New York City in December 2010, and remaining amounts related principally to our data centers and related equipment, and cash consideration used in acquisitions and other investments of $1,067 million. Also, in connection with our securities lending program, we received $2,361 million of cash collateral which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements. Of the $2,361 million, $1,611 million was classified as cash and cash equivalents, and $750 million was classified as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about our securities lending program.\nCash used in investing activities in 2009 of $8,019 million was primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of $7,036 million and capital expenditures of $810 million.\nCash used in investing activities in 2008 of $5,319 million was primarily attributable to cash consideration used in acquisitions and other investments of $3,367 million primarily related to the acquisition of DoubleClick and capital expenditures of $2,359 million, partially offset by net maturities and sales of marketable securities of $407 million including our investment in Clearwire.\nIn order to manage expected increases in internet traffic, advertising transactions, and new products and services, and to support our overall global business expansion, we expect to make significant investments in our systems, data centers, corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure, and employees in 2011 and thereafter. However, the amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis.\nIn addition, we expect to spend a significant amount of cash on acquisitions and other investments from time to time. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product offerings.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2010 of $3,050 million was primarily driven by $3,463 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and a promissory note. This was partially offset by $801\nmillion in stock repurchases in connection with our acquisitions of AdMob and On2 Technologies, Inc. (On2), as well as net proceeds from stock-based award activities of $294 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities of $94 million.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2009 of $233 million was primarily due to net proceeds related to stock-based award activities of $143 million. In addition, there were excess tax benefits of $90 million from stock-based award activities during the period which represented a portion of the $260 million reduction to income taxes payable that we recorded in 2009 related to the total direct tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale, or vesting of these awards.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2008 of $87 million was primarily due to excess tax benefits of $159 million from stock-based award activities during the period which represents a portion of the $251 million reduction to income tax payable that we recorded in 2008 related to the total direct tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale, or vesting of these awards, partially offset by net payments related to stock-based award activities of $72 million.\nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2010\nThe above table does not include future rental income of $812 million related to the leases that we assumed in connection with our purchase of an office building in New York City.\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring between 2011 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the above table. Certain of these leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases have adjustments for market provisions.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations represent non-cancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 2010. In addition, we had $2.4 billion of open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods at December 31, 2010. This amount is not included in the above table because we have the right to cancel the purchase orders prior to the date of delivery. The majority of our non-cancelable contractual obligations are related to data center operations and facility build-outs.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities consist of cash obligations, primarily the legal settlement with the Authors Guild and the AAP, and milestone and royalty payments owed in connection with certain acquisitions and licensing agreements.\nIn addition, we recorded additional long-term taxes payable of $289 million in 2010 related to tax positions for which the timing of the ultimate resolution is uncertain. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table.\nOff-Balance Sheet Entities\nAt December 31, 2010, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nAlthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.\nOur effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, state taxes, certain benefits realized related to stock option activities, and research and experimentation tax credits. The effective tax rates were 27.8%, 22.2%, and 21.2% for 2008, 2009, and 2010. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax\nassets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, and accounting principles. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business. We record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. Such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding legal contingencies.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur stock-based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and expected term. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model changes significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our marketable securities and our non-marketable equity securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value, the potential recovery period, and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the investment before recovery. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our Consolidated Statement of Income.",
         "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nEconomic Exposure\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues, as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We purchase foreign exchange option contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The gain on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest and other income, net, if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring. Any gain after a hedge is de-designated or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized as interest and other income, net, immediately.\nAt December 31, 2009, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros were 1.6 billion (or approximately $2.2 billion) and $59 million; the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds were £809 million (or approximately $1.3 billion) and $39 million; and the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars were C$306 million (or approximately $268 million) and $6 million. At December 31, 2010, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros were 3.0 billion (or approximately $4.1 billion) and $227 million; the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds were £1.5 billion (or approximately $2.3 billion) and $97 million; and the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars were C$407 million (or approximately $382 million) and $6 million. These foreign exchange options have maturities of 36 months or less. There are no other foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges. However, we may enter into similar contracts in other foreign currencies in the future.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% for our foreign currencies instruments could be experienced in the near term.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 20%, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income before tax effect would have been approximately $15 million and $140 million lower at December 31, 2009 and 2010, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest and other income, net, would have been approximately $68 million and $134 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20%, the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income before tax effect would have been approximately $555 million and $1.2 billion higher at December 31, 2009 and 2010, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest and other income, net, would have been approximately $75 million and $175 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010.\nTransaction Exposure\nOur exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary, primarily the Euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen. Our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency. We have entered into foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary.\nThe notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $2.4 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2010. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars for foreign currencies was $115 million and $84 million at December 31, 2009 and 2010. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with other currencies was 618 million (or approximately $889 million) and 991 million (or approximately $1.3 billion) at December 31, 2009 and 2010. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros for other foreign currencies was 8 million (or approximately $11 million) and 6 million (or approximately $8 million) at December 31, 2009 and 2010.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $102 million and $20 million at December 31, 2009 and 2010. The adverse impact at December 31, 2009 and 2010 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $594 million and $467 million from forward exchange contracts in place for the months of December 2009 and 2010. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, time deposits, money market and other funds, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate securities. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.\nInvestments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our income from investments may decrease in the future.\nWe considered the historical volatility of short-term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable securities of approximately $291 million and $895 million at December 31, 2009 and 2010.",

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nGoogle Inc.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nFinancial Statements:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe supplementary financial information required by this Item 8 is included in Item 7 under the caption “Quarterly Results of Operations.”\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Google Inc.\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Google Inc. at December 31, 2009 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 11, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 11, 2011\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Google Inc.\nWe have audited Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Google Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, Google Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of Google Inc. and our report dated February 11, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 11, 2011\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except share and par value amounts which are reflected in thousands,\nand par value per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(In millions, except for share amounts which are reflected in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Google Inc. and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nWe were incorporated in California in September 1998. We were re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. We generate revenue primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Google Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table presents our revenues by revenue source (in millions):\nGoogle AdWords is our auction-based advertising program that enables advertisers to place text-based and display ads on our websites and our Google Network members’ websites. Display advertising comprises the videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets. Most of our AdWords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our websites and our Google Network members’ websites as specified by the advertiser.\nGoogle AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on our Google Network members’ websites, as well as programs to deliver ads on television broadcasts.\nWe recognize as revenues the fees charged advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the text-based ads that are displayed next to the search results pages on our website or on the search results pages or content pages of our Google Network members’ websites and, for those advertisers who use our cost-per impression pricing, the fees charged advertisers each time an ad is displayed on our members’ websites. We report our Google AdSense revenues on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisers.\nGoogle ads for televisions enable advertisers, operators, and programmers to buy, schedule, deliver, and measure ads on television. We recognize as revenue the fees charged advertisers each time an ad is displayed on television in accordance with the terms of the related agreements.\nWe also offer display advertising management services such as media planning, buying, implementation, and measurement tools for advertisers and agencies, and forecasting and reporting tools for publishers. We recognize the related fees as other revenues in the period advertising impressions are delivered.\nGoogle Checkout is our online shopping payment processing system for both consumers and merchants. We recognize as revenues any fees charged to merchants on transactions processed through Google Checkout. Further, cash ultimately paid to merchants under Google Checkout promotions, including cash paid to merchants as a result of discounts provided to consumers on certain transactions processed through Google Checkout, are accounted for as an offset to revenues.\nWe generate fees from search services on a per-query basis. Our policy is to recognize revenues from per-query search fees in the period we provide the search results.\nWe also generate fees from the sale and licensing of our Search Appliance products, which include hardware, software, and post-contract support primarily for two years. Prior to 2010, as the deliverables were not sold separately, sufficient vendor-specific objective evidence did not exist for the allocation of revenue. As a result, we recognized the entire fee for the sale and license of these products ratably over the term of the post-contract support arrangement. Beginning the first quarter of 2010, we adopted the new accounting guidance which requires us to allocate the consideration of the arrangement to each of the deliverables based on our best estimate of their standalone selling prices as there is no vendor-specific objective or third-party evidence of the selling prices. As a result, we now recognize revenue allocated to the hardware and software at the time of sale and revenue allocated to post-contract support ratably over the term of the service arrangement. The adoption of this new accounting guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, we generate fees through the licensing of our Google Apps products. We recognize as revenue the fees we charge customers for hosting the related enterprise applications and services ratably over the term of the service arrangement.\nRevenues realized through display advertising management services, Google ads for televisions, Google Checkout, search services, Search Appliance, and Google Apps were not material in any of the years presented.\nWe recognize revenues as described above because the services have been provided, the fees we charge are fixed or determinable, we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe record deferred revenue upon invoicing or when cash payments are received in advance of our performance in the underlying agreement on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately paid to our Google Network members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or\notherwise direct search queries to our website (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share arrangements with our Google Network members and distribution partners.\nCertain distribution arrangements require us to pay our distribution partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not exclusively-or at all-based on revenue share. These fees are non-refundable. Further, these distribution arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. We recognize fees under these distribution arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points (approximately two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year, or based on any contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenues. Further, we review the access points for impairment by distribution partner, type, and geography, and we have not made any impairment to date.\nPrepaid revenue share and distribution fees are included in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy, bandwidth costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions including Google Checkout transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as content acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our websites and our Google Network members’ websites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers and the Google Network members.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe have elected to use the BSM option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. Shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the statutory withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of RSUs outstanding. Furthermore, we record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us as a reduction to additional paid-in capital when paid. Also, we recognize stock-based compensation using the straight-line method.\nWe include as part of cash flows from financing activities the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax-effected compensation of the related stock-based awards for options exercised and RSUs vested during the period. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $73 million, $350 million, and $656 million, and the total direct tax benefit realized, including the excess tax benefit, from stock-based award activities was $251 million, $260 million, and $355 million. We have elected to account for the indirect effects of stock-based awards-primarily the research and development tax credit-through the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010 we recognized stock-based compensation and related tax benefits of $1,120 million and $232 million, $1,164 million and $264 million, and $1,376 million and $314 million.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nOur revenues are principally derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, our revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the world. Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate securities. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. In 2008, 2009, and 2010 we generated approximately 49%, 47%, and 48% of our revenues from customers based in the U.S., with the majority of customers outside of the U.S. located in Europe and Japan. Many of our Google Network members are in the internet industry. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend, but generally we do not require collateral from our customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations.\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2008, 2009, and 2010.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term debt, and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value because of their generally short maturities. We carry marketable securities and foreign currency contracts at fair value. See Notes 3 and 6 for more information.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nWe invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate securities. We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities.\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as available-for-sale. We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other-than-temporary which we record as interest and other income, net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of interest and other income, net.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe have accounted for non-marketable equity security investments primarily at cost because we do not have significant influence over the underlying investees.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our marketable securities, as well as our non-marketable equity securities, for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is\nother-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period, and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the investment before recovery. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we do not charge interest. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers. We determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. We depreciate buildings over periods up to 25 years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property (including land) and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. Depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for their intended use. Land is not depreciated.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed to external users, before technological feasibility of such products is reached. We have determined that technological feasibility was reached shortly before the release of those products and as a result, the development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before the release of those products were not material, and accordingly, were expensed as incurred. Software development costs also include costs to develop software programs to be used solely to meet our internal needs. The costs we incurred during the application development stage for these software programs were not material in the years presented.\nLong-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. We have made no material adjustments to our long-lived assets in any of the years presented. In addition, we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired. Our tests are based on our single operating segment and reporting unit structure. We found no impairment in any of the years presented.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one to 12 years.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize income taxes under the liability method. We recognize deferred income taxes for differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity. We recorded $84 million of net translation losses in 2008, $77 million of net translation gains in 2009, and $124 million of net translation losses in 2010. We record net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions as a component of interest and other income, net. These gains and losses are net of those realized on forward foreign exchange contracts. We recorded $36 million of net losses in 2008, $8 million of net gains in 2009, and $29 million of net losses in 2010.\nLegal Costs\nLegal costs are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010 advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $266 million, $353 million, and $772 million.\nNote 2. Net Income Per Share of Class A and Class B Common Stock\nWe compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period except that it does not include unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, warrants, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and warrants is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Further, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock (in this case the right of our Class A common stock to receive an equal dividend to any declared on our Class B common stock) must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our Board of Directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation\nrights of the Class A and Class B common shares as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):\nThe net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.\nNote 3. Cash and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities consist of the following (in millions):\n(1) The balance at December 31, 2010 includes $1.6 billion of cash collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months. See below for further discussion on this program. No similar amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 2009.\nThe following table summarizes unrealized gains and losses related to our investments in marketable securities designated as available-for-sale (in millions):\nGross unrealized gains and losses on cash equivalents were not material at December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010.\nWe recognized gross realized gains of $118 million and $212 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010. Gross realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 were not material. Gross realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $27 million. We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we reflect such gains and losses as a component of interest and other income, net, in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable securities, excluding the marketable equity security, designated as available-for-sale and classified by the contractual maturity date of the security (in millions):\nThe following tables present gross unrealized losses and fair values for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2009 and 2010, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2009 and 2010, we did not have any investments in marketable securities that were in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater.\nAuction Rate Securities\nAt December 31, 2010, we held $153 million of auction rate securities (ARS). The assets underlying these 29 individual investments are primarily student loans which are mostly AAA rated and substantially guaranteed by the U.S. government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Historically, these securities have provided liquidity through a Dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals every 7 to 49 days. However, these auctions began to fail in the first quarter of 2008. Since these auctions have failed, we have realized higher interest rates for many of these ARS than we would have otherwise. Although we have\nbeen receiving interest payments at these generally higher rates, the related principal amounts will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the issuer calls the security, or the security matures according to contractual terms. Maturity dates for these ARS investments range from 2025 to 2047. Since these auctions have failed, $98 million of the related securities were called at par by their issuers.\nAs a result of the auction failures, these ARS do not have a readily determinable market value. To estimate their fair values at December 31, 2010, we used a discounted cash flow model based on estimated interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, the credit quality of the underlying securities, and illiquidity considerations. Specifically, we estimated the future cash flows of our ARS over the expected workout periods using a projected weighted-average interest rate of 2.6% per annum, which is based on the forward swap curve at the end of December 2010 plus any additional basis points currently paid by the issuers assuming these auctions continue to fail. A discount factor was applied over these estimated cash flows of our ARS, which is calculated based on the interpolated forward swap curve adjusted by up to 1,700 basis points to reflect the current market conditions for instruments with similar credit quality at the date of the valuation and further adjusted by up to 400 basis points to reflect a discount for the liquidity risk associated with these investments due to the lack of an active market.\nAt December 31, 2010, the estimated fair value of these ARS was $20 million less than their costs. As we have no intent to sell these ARS and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these ARS prior to recovery of our entire cost basis, we concluded the decline in the fair value was temporary and recorded the unrealized loss to accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010.\nTo the extent we determine that any impairment is other-than-temporary, we would record a charge to earnings. In addition, we have concluded that the auctions for these securities may continue to fail for at least the next 12 months and as a result, we classified them as non-current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010.\nSecurities Lending Program\nFrom time to time, we enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income. We loan selected securities that are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities. These loaned securities continued to be classified as cash equivalents or marketable securities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral is invested in reverse repurchase agreements. A reverse repurchase agreement is an agreement under which a buyer agrees to purchase an asset with a simultaneous agreement to resell the same asset on a given date at a specified price. We record the cash collateral as an asset with a corresponding liability. We classify reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months as cash equivalents and those longer than three months as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For lending agreements collateralized by securities, we do not record an asset or liability as we are not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral.\nInvestment in Marketable and Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nIn 2008, we recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges of $726 million and $355 million related to our investments in AOL and Clearwire. In 2009, we sold our investment in AOL to Time Warner Inc. for $283 million and recognized a gain of $9 million.\nNote 4. Short-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from the commercial paper program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2010, we had $3.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.3% that matures at various dates through November 2011. The estimated fair value of the commercial paper approximates its carrying value. In conjunction with this program, we established a $3.0 billion\nrevolving credit facility expiring on June 30, 2013. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2010.\nIn December 2010, we issued a secured promissory note in the amount of $468 million with an interest rate of 1.0% that matures in one year. Proceeds were used for the acquisition of an office building in New York City (see Note 7).\nNote 5. Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Our program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as interest and other income, net, as part of revenues, or to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe use options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We initially report any gain on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify to revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest and other income, net, if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring.\nAt December 31, 2010, the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was $144 million, of which $99 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI to revenues within the next 12 months.\nWe recognize any gain after a hedge is de-designated or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge in interest and other income, net, immediately. Further, we exclude the change in the time value of the options from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We record the premium paid or time value of an option whose strike price is equal to or greater than the market price on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter, we recognize any change to this time value in interest and other income, net.\nThe notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros was 1.6 billion (or approximately $2.2 billion) and 3.0 billion (or approximately $4.1 billion) at December 31, 2009 and 2010; the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds was £809 million (or approximately $1.3 billion) and £1.5 billion (or approximately $2.3 billion) at December 31, 2009 and 2010; and the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars was C$306 million (or approximately $268 million) and C$407 million (or approximately $382 million) at December 31, 2009 and 2010. These foreign exchange options have maturities of 36 months or less. We have not designated any other foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges.\nFair Value Hedges\nIn November 2009, we began using forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in interest and other income, net, along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in the time value for forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize them in interest and other income, net. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $37 million and $787 million at December 31, 2009 and 2010.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts that we use to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in interest and other income, net, along with the gains and losses of the related hedged items. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $2.4 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2010. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars for foreign currencies was $115 million and $84 million at December 31, 2009 and 2010. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with other currencies was 618 million (or approximately $889 million) and 991 million (or approximately $1.3 billion) at December 31, 2009 and 2010. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros for other foreign currencies was 8 million (or approximately $11 million) and 6 million (or approximately $8 million) at December 31, 2009 and 2010.\nThe fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments at December 31, 2009 and 2010 is summarized below (in millions):\nThe effect of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationship on income and other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010 is summarized below (in millions):\nGains (losses) related to the ineffective portion of the hedges were not material in all periods presented.\nThe effect of derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationship on income for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010 is summarized below (in millions):\nLosses related to the amount excluded from effectiveness testing of the hedges were none and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2010.\nThe effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on income for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010 is summarized below (in millions):\nNote 6. Fair Value Measurements\nWe measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign currency derivative contracts, and ARS at fair value. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2-Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2. This is because we value our cash equivalents and marketable securities using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. We classify our foreign currency derivative contracts within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments. We classify our investments in ARS within Level 3 because they are valued using valuation techniques (see Note 3). Some of the inputs to these models are unobservable in the market and are significant.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions):\n(1) This balance represents the cash collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months.\nThe following table presents reconciliations for our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\nNote 7. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consist of the following (in millions):\nIn December 2010, we completed an acquisition of an office building in New York City for total cash consideration of $1.8 billion, of which approximately $700 million was allocated to land and $1.1 billion was allocated to building. This purchase was accounted for as a business combination in accordance with the U.S. GAAP. We occupy a portion of the building and lease out the remaining portion. We depreciate the building on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of 25 years. In connection with this purchase, we issued a secured promissory note in the amount of $468 million with an interest rate of 1.0% that matures in one year.\nNote 8. Acquisitions\nIn December 2010, we completed the acquisition of Widevine Technologies, Inc. (Widevine), a privately-held content protection and video optimization technology company for a cash consideration of $158 million.\nIn August 2010, we completed the acquisition of Slide, Inc. (Slide), a privately-held social technology company for a cash consideration of $179 million.\nIn May 2010, we completed the acquisition of AdMob, a privately-held mobile display ads technology provider. The purchase price was $681 million, consisting of the issuance of approximately 1.2 million shares of our Class A common stock and assumed vested options valued at $655 million, and cash of $26 million. The issued shares were valued based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on May 27, 2010. The fair values of stock options assumed were estimated using the BSM option pricing model.\nIn February 2010, we completed the acquisition of On2, a publicly-held company, and developer of video compression technology. The purchase price was $123 million, consisting of the issuance of approximately 174,000 shares of our Class A common stock valued at $95 million, based on the closing price of our Class A common stock on February 19, 2010, and cash of $28 million.\nTo offset the dilutive impact of issuing shares in connection with the AdMob and On2 acquisitions, we also repurchased and subsequently retired 1.6 million shares of our Class A common stock for $801 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2010, we also completed 44 other acquisitions for a total cash consideration of approximately $669 million. These acquisitions were not material individually or in the aggregate.\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price for all the acquisitions (in millions):\nFor all acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2010, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 4.9 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 3.6 years and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 3.8 years. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is $35 million.\nNote 9. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows (in millions):\nInformation regarding our acquisition-related intangible assets that are being amortized is as follows (in millions):\nPatents and developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names and other have weighted-average useful lives from the date of purchase of 4.3 years, 5.9 years, and 4.2 years. Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010 was $280 million, $266 million, and $314 million. As of December 31, 2010, expected amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter was as follows (in millions):\nNote 10. Interest and Other Income, Net\nThe components of interest and other income, net are as follows (in millions):\nNote 11. Comprehensive Income\nThe changes in the components of comprehensive income are as follows (in millions):\n(1) Change in unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investments is recorded net of taxes of $9 million, $6 million, and $52 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n(2) Change in unrealized gains on cash flow hedges is recorded net of taxes of $144 million, $138 million, and $52 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2009, and 2010.\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as follows (in millions):\nNote 12. Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring between 2011 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table below. Certain of these arrangements have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis.\nAt December 31, 2010, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases, along with sublease income amounts, were as follows over each of the next five years and thereafter (in millions):\nCertain leases have adjustments for market provisions. Amounts in the above table represent our best estimates of future payments to be made under these leases. In addition, the above table does not include future rental income of $812 million related to the leases that we assumed in connection with our purchase of an office building in New York City. Rent expense under operating leases, including co-location arrangements, was $314 million, $323 million, and $293 million in 2008, 2009, and 2010.\nPurchase Obligations\nWe had $565 million of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, principally for data center activities, and $2.4 billion of open purchase orders for which we had not received the related services or goods at December 31, 2010. We have the right to cancel these open purchase orders prior to the date of delivery.\nLetters of Credit\nAt December 31, 2010, we had unused letters of credit for $65 million.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business to facilitate transactions of our services and products, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network members, and lessors with respect to certain matters. We have\nagreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, the payments we have made under these agreements have not had a material impact on our operating results, financial position, or cash flows.\nLegal Matters\nWe have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies, including Android, Google WebSearch, Google AdWords, Google AdSense, Google News, Google Image Search, Google Chrome, Google Talk, Google Voice, and YouTube, infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also result in a change in our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.\nIn addition, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Furthermore, such customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.\nWe are also involved in other claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to intellectual property claims, competition and antitrust matters, privacy matters, tax matters, labor and employment claims, commercial claims, and other matters.\nAlthough the results of such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of the matters discussed above will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEPA Investigation\nIn February 2009, we learned of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation into an alleged release of refrigerant at one of our smaller data facilities, which we acquired from DoubleClick, and the accuracy of related statements and records. We are cooperating with the EPA and have provided documents and other materials. The EPA investigation could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other administrative action. We believe this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are under audit by the IRS and various other tax authorities. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of tax benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\nNote 13. Stockholders’ Equity\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized 100,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. At December 31, 2009 and 2010, there were no shares issued or outstanding.\nClass A and Class B Common Stock\nOur Board of Directors has authorized two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. At December 31, 2010, there were 6,000,000,000 and 3,000,000,000 shares authorized and there were 250,413,518 and 70,887,939 shares outstanding of Class A and Class B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock. We refer to Class A and Class B common stock as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nStock Plans\nWe maintain the 1998 Stock Plan, the 2000 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan (No. 2), the 2003 Stock Plan (No. 3), the 2004 Stock Plan, and plans assumed through acquisitions, all of which are collectively referred to as the “Stock Plans.” Under our Stock Plans, incentive and nonqualified stock options or rights to purchase common stock may be granted to eligible participants. Options are generally granted for a term of 10 years. Except for options granted pursuant to our stock option exchange program completed in March 2009 (the Exchange), options granted under the Stock Plans generally vest 25% after the first year of service and ratably each month over the remaining 36-month period contingent upon employment with us on the vesting date. Options granted under Stock Plans other than the 2004 Stock Plan may be exercised prior to vesting.\nUnder the Stock Plans, we have also issued RSUs and restricted shares. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our stock at the time of vest. RSUs issued to new employees vest over four years with a yearly cliff contingent upon employment with us on the dates of vest. These RSUs vest from zero to 50.0% of the grant amount at the end of each of the four years from date of hire based on the employee’s performance. RSUs under the Founders’ Award programs are issued to individuals on teams that have made extraordinary contributions to Google. These awards vest quarterly over four years contingent upon employment with us on the vesting dates.\nAt December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010, there were 27,042,948 and 27,329,837 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plans.\nWe estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the BSM option pricing model. Our assumptions about stock-price volatility have been based exclusively on the implied volatilities of publicly traded options to buy our stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life of options granted to our employees. We estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock options granted (excluding options granted in connection with the Exchange discussed below) in the periods presented:\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our options for the year ended December 31, 2010:\n(1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the closing stock price of $593.97 of our Class A common stock on December 31, 2010.\n(2) Options expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nThe following table summarizes additional information regarding outstanding, exercisable, and exercisable and vested stock options and warrants at December 31, 2010:\nThe above tables include approximately 1.1 million warrants held by selected financial institutions that were options purchased from employees under our TSO program, with a weighted-average exercise price of $319.54 and a weighted-average remaining life of 1.2 years.\nThe total grant date fair value of stock options vested during 2008, 2009, and 2010 was $693 million, $690 million, and $690 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of all options and warrants exercised during 2008, 2009, and 2010 was $503 million, $566 million, and $794 million. These amounts do not include the aggregate sales price of options sold under our TSO program.\nDuring 2010, the number of shares underlying TSOs sold to selected financial institutions under the TSO program was 747,647 at a total value of $173 million, or an average of $231.81 per share, including an average premium of $20.11 per share. The premium is calculated as the difference between (a) the sale price of the TSO and (b) the intrinsic value of the TSO, which we define as the excess, if any, of the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the sale over the exercise price of the TSO.\nIn March 2009, we completed an offer to exchange certain employee stock options issued under our 2004 Stock Plan. Certain previously granted options were exchanged for new options with a lower exercise price granted on a one-for-one basis. Options for an aggregate of approximately 7.6 million shares of our Class A common stock were exchanged. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have an exercise price of $308.57 per share, the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 6, 2009. Options granted pursuant to the Exchange have a new vesting schedule determined by adding 12 months to each vesting date under the exchanged options’ original vesting schedule. In addition, new options will vest no sooner than six months after the date of the Exchange. The Exchange resulted in a modification charge of approximately $360 million which is being recognized over the vesting periods of the new options. These vesting periods range from six months to five years. We recorded approximately $103 million and $86 million of the modification charge during 2009 and 2010.\nAs of December 31, 2010, there was $889 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding employee stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs and restricted shares for the year ended December 31, 2010:\n(1) RSUs and restricted shares expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nAs of December 31, 2010, there was $2,606 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to employee unvested RSUs and restricted shares. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nNote 14. 401(k) Plan\nWe have a 401(k) Savings Plan (401(k) Plan) that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 60% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Employee and our contributions are fully vested when contributed. We contributed approximately $73 million, $83 million, and $100 million during 2008, 2009, and 2010.\nNote 15. Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $2,059 million, $3,579 million, and $4,948 million for 2008, 2009, and 2010, and income from foreign operations of $3,794 million, $4,802 million, and $5,848 million for 2008, 2009, and 2010. Substantially all of the income from foreign operations was earned by an Irish subsidiary.\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions):\nThe reconciliation of federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):\nWe have not provided U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of December 31, 2010, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $17.5 billion. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.\nDeferred Tax Assets\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2010, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $362 million and $252 million. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2015. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nIn 2008, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.1 billion related primarily to our investments in AOL and Clearwire. For income tax purposes, the impairment would generate an equal amount of capital loss when recognized, a portion of which was recognized in 2009. As of December 31, 2010, our federal and state capital loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $682 million and $936 million. If not utilized, the recognized federal and state capital losses of $327 million and $581 million will begin to expire in 2014. We believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the capital loss carryforwards will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance on both our federal and state capital loss carryforwards in the amount of $292 million. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2010 (in millions):\nOur total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $561 million, $814 million, and $951 million as of December 31, 2008, 2009 and 2010.\nAs of December 31, 2009 and 2010, we had accrued $100 million and $97 million for payment of interest and penalties. Interest and penalties included in our provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.\nWe and our subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. Although we file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns, our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and Ireland. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, the IRS completed its examination of our 2003 and 2004 tax years. We have filed an appeal with the IRS for certain issues related to this audit and no resolution of the issues has been achieved at this time but we believe we have adequately provided for these items and any adverse results would have an immaterial impact on our unrecognized tax benefit balance within the next 12 months. The IRS has completed its examination of our 2005 and 2006 tax years. As a result, we settled and released certain tax reserves in the three\nmonths ended September 30, 2010. The IRS commenced its examination of our 2007 and 2008 tax years in early 2010. We do not expect the examination to be completed within the next 12 months. Therefore, we do not anticipate any significant impact to our unrecognized tax benefit balance in 2011, related to our 2007 and 2008 tax years.\nOur 2009 and 2010 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes, and our 2003 through 2010 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are various other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\nNote 16. Information about Geographic Areas\nOur chief operating decision-makers (i.e., chief executive officer, certain of his direct reports, and our founders) review financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. There are no segment managers who are held accountable by our chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for operations, operating results, and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we consider ourselves to be in a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.\nRevenues by geography are based on the billing addresses of our customers. The following table sets forth revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area (in millions):",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2010, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2010 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.",

In addition, the third parties that comprise the Google Network use our AdSense program to deliver relevant ads that generate revenue and enhance the user experience.\nWe were incorporated in California in September 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware in August 2003. Our headquarters are located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, and our telephone number is (650) 253-0000. We completed our initial public offering in August 2004 and our Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG.”\nCorporate Highlights\nOn April 4, 2011, Larry Page, our Co-Founder, assumed day-to-day operations as our Chief Executive Officer. Since then, Larry’s primary focus has been on “increasing Google’s velocity and execution”-making things much simpler for our users and improving the overall Google experience while continually creating new products with the potential to improve the lives of billions of people.\n•\nAndroid-The growth of our Android operating system in 2011 has been impressive. As of January 2012, over 250 million Android devices have been activated globally.\n•\nImproved Ad Formats-We made a number of ad improvements in 2011. For instance, with visual ads, not only can users find theater times for a new movie, users can watch the trailer directly in the ad. Location-aware search ads can help users find what they are looking for more easily by putting thousands of local businesses on the map-literally. With the +1 button, people can find businesses recommended by their friends. After all, ads are just more answers to users’ queries.\n•\nGoogle+-In June 2011, we launched Google+, a new way to share online just like users do in the real world, sharing different things with different people. Google+ has added new users every week since its launch. As of January 2012, over 90 million people have joined Google+.\n•\nProduct Prioritization-In an effort to prioritize our product efforts, we decided to shut down a number of products in 2011, including Google Buzz, Google Desktop, and Google Labs. We learned a lot from these discontinued products and are putting that learning to work every day in new products such as Google+.\n•\nNew and Improved Google Experience-Constant revision and improvement is part of our overarching philosophy. In 2011, we began work on improving the Google experience guided by three key design principles:\n•\nFocus-With the new design changes, we have brought forward the things that matter to users and moved all the other clutter out of their way so that users can better focus on what they need at the moment.\n•\nElasticity-The new design allows users to seamlessly transition from one device to another from the various mobile devices, tablets, high-resolution monitors, and TVs to access the web and have a consistent visual experience.\n•\nEffortlessness-Our design philosophy is to combine power with simplicity. We want to keep our look simple and clean, but behind the seemingly simple design, use technologies like HTML5, WebGL, and the latest, fastest browsers to make sure users have all the power of the web behind them.\nOn August 15, 2011, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Motorola, a provider of innovative technologies, products and services that enable a range of mobile and wireline digital communication, information and entertainment experiences, under which we will acquire Motorola for $40 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $12.5 billion. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.\nOur business is primarily focused around the following key areas: search, advertising, operating systems and platforms, and enterprise.\nSearch\nWe maintain a vast index of websites and other online content, and make it available through our search engine to anyone with an internet connection. Our search technologies sort through an ever-growing amount of information to deliver relevant and useful search results in response to user queries. We integrate innovative features into our search service and offer specialized search services to help users tailor their search. In addition, we are constantly improving and adding to our products and services, to provide users with more relevant results so that users find what they are looking for faster.\nIn January 2012, we launched Search plus Your World. Now, when a user performs a signed-in search on Google, the user’s results page may include Google+ content from people that the user is close to (or might be interested in following). Relevant Google+ profiles and Google+ pages related to a specific topic or area of interest may also appear on a user’s results page.\nAdvertising\nGoogle Search. The goal of AdWords, our primary auction-based advertising program, is to deliver ads that are so useful and relevant to search queries or web content that they are a form of information in their own right. With AdWords, advertisers create simple text-based ads that then appear beside related search results or web content on our websites and on thousands of partner websites in our Google Network, which is the network of third parties that use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads with their search results and content. Most of our AdWords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites as specified by the advertiser.\nOur AdSense program enables websites that are part of the Google Network to deliver ads from our AdWords advertisers that are relevant to the search results or content on their websites. We share the majority of the revenues generated from these ads with the Google Network Members that display the ads. The AdSense program enables advertisers to extend the reach of their ad campaigns, improves our partners’ ability to generate revenue from their content, and delivers relevant ads for their users.\nGoogle Display. Display advertising comprises the videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets. The Google Display Network provides advertisers services related to the delivery of display advertising across publishers participating in our AdSense program, publishers participating in the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, and Google-owned sites such as YouTube and Google Finance.\nThrough our DoubleClick advertising technology, we provide to publishers, agencies, and advertisers the ad serving technology, which is the infrastructure that enables billions of ads to be served each day across the web. Our DoubleClick Ad Exchange creates a real-time auction marketplace for the trading of display ad space. We aim to simplify display advertising so it is easier for advertisers and publishers to manage campaigns across different formats, on different websites, and for different devices.\nIn addition, YouTube provides a range of video, interactive, and other ad formats for advertisers to reach their intended audience. YouTube’s video advertising solutions give advertisers a way to promote their content to the YouTube community, as well as to associate with content being watched by their target audience. YouTube also offers analytic tools to help advertisers understand their audience and derive general business intelligence. In the past year, YouTube has experienced strong growth in mobile viewers and has established key partnerships with content companies to help monetize mobile video.\nGoogle Mobile. Mobile advertising is still in relative infancy, though the mobile device is quickly becoming the world’s newest gateway to information. Google is focused on developing easy-to-use ad products to help advertisers extend their reach, help create revenue opportunities for our publisher partners, and deliver relevant and useful ads to users on the go.\nGoogle Mobile extends our products and services by providing mobile-specific features to mobile device users. Our mobile-specific search technologies include search by voice, search by sight, and search by location. Google Mobile also optimizes a large number of Google’s applications for mobile devices in both browser and downloadable form. In addition, we offer advertisers the ability to run search ad campaigns on mobile devices with popular mobile-specific ad formats, such as click-to-call ads in which advertisers can include a phone number within ad text. In 2010, we acquired AdMob, Inc. (AdMob), which offers effective ad units and solutions for application developers and advertisers. We continue to invest in improving users’ access to Google services through their mobile devices.\nGoogle Local. Google is committed to providing users with relevant local information. We’ve organized information around more than 50 million places globally from various sources across the web. Users can find addresses, phone numbers, hours of operation, directions and more for millions of local queries like shops, restaurants, parks and landmarks right on Google.com, on Google Maps and on Google Maps for mobile. They can also discover more places that are right for them by rating the places they’ve been, and getting customized recommendations based on their tastes and those of their friends directly within Google Maps. Our products and services also help local business owners manage their online presence and connect with potential customers. Millions of business owners have verified their free business listings via Google Places to ensure that users have up-to-date information about their establishments, and to contribute additional details such as photos and products/services offered. Google Offers brings people daily deals from local and national businesses, redeemable for discounted goods or services. From restaurants to spa treatments to outdoor adventures, Google has deals from the best businesses a city has to offer as well as popular national brands.\nOperating Systems and Platforms\nAndroid. Working closely with the Open Handset Alliance, a business alliance of more than 75 technology and mobile companies, we developed Android, a free, fully open source mobile software platform that any developer can use to create applications for mobile devices and any handset manufacturer can install on a device. We believe Android will drive greater innovation and choice in the mobile device ecosystem, and provide consumers with a more powerful mobile experience.\nGoogle Chrome OS and Google Chrome. Google Chrome OS is an open source operating system with the Google Chrome web browser as its foundation. Both the Google Chrome OS and the Google Chrome browser are built around the core tenets of speed, simplicity, and security. Designed for people who spend most of their time on the web, the Google Chrome OS is a new approach to operating systems. We are working with several original equipment manufacturers to bring computers running Google Chrome OS to users and businesses. The Chrome browser runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux computers.\nGoogle+. In June 2011, we launched Google+, a new way to share online just like users do in the real world, sharing different things with different people. Google+ has added new users every week since its launch. As of January 2012, over 90 million people have joined Google+.\nGoogle TV. Google TV is a platform that gives consumers the power to experience television and the internet on a single screen, with the ability to search and find the content they want to watch. The Google TV platform is based on the Android operating system and runs the Google Chrome browser.\nGoogle Books. The Google Books platform (including reading applications, an electronic bookstore (eBookstore), book search, and personal library management) is designed to help people discover, search, and consume content from printed books online. Through the Google eBookstore, we make available for sale popular books in electronic book format to complement our large collection of free public domain books.\nEnterprise\nGoogle’s enterprise products provide familiar, easy-to-use Google technology for business settings. Through Google Apps, which includes Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendar, and Google Sites, among other features, we provide hosted, web-based applications that people can use on any device with a browser and an internet connection. In addition, we provide our search technology for use within enterprises through the Google Search Appliance (real-time search of business applications, intranet applications, and public websites), on their public-facing sites with Google Site Search (custom search engine), and Google Commerce Search (for online retail enterprises). We also provide versions of our Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API) for businesses (including fully interactive Google Maps for public and internal websites), as well as Google Earth Enterprise (a behind-the-company-firewall software solution for imagery and data visualization). Our enterprise solutions have been adopted by a variety of businesses, governments, schools, and non-profit organizations. Google Apps is the first cloud computing suite of message and collaboration tools to receive U.S. government security certification.\nResearch\nWe continue to develop new products and services and to enhance our existing ones through research and product development and the licensing and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Our product development philosophy is to launch innovative products early and often, and then iterate rapidly to make those products even better. We often post early stage products at test locations online or directly on Google.com. We then use data and user feedback to decide if and how to invest further in those products.\nOur research and development expenses were $2.8 billion, $3.8 billion, and $5.2 billion in 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively, which included stock-based compensation expense of $725 million, $861 million, and $1.1 billion, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in building the employee and systems infrastructures needed to support the development of new products and services and to improve existing ones.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. Over time, we have assembled a portfolio of patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, and trade secrets covering our products and services. Our proprietary technology is not dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. Although we rigorously protect our proprietary technology, any significant impairment of, or third-party claim against, our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.\nSales and Support\nWe continue to develop and grow our sales and support infrastructure. We have over 85 offices in over 40 countries, the large majority of which include sales people. Our global sales and support infrastructure has\nspecialized teams across vertical markets. We bring businesses into our advertising network through direct, remote, and online sales channels, using technology and automation wherever possible to improve our customers’ experience and to grow our business cost-effectively. Our direct advertising and sales teams focus on building relationships with the largest advertisers and leading internet companies. We have built a multi-product sales force, with teams selling campaigns that include search, display (including DoubleClick and YouTube), and mobile advertising.\nWe provide customer service to our advertiser base through our global support organization. Our global support organization concentrates on helping our advertisers and Google Network Members get the most out of their relationship with us.\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2009, 2010, or 2011.\nGovernment Contracts\nNo material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.\nMarketing\nGoogle’s global brand is well known. We believe that building a trusted, highly recognized brand begins with providing high-quality products and services that make a notable difference in people’s lives. Marketing is responsible for generating advertiser revenue through marketing campaigns to small businesses, as well as providing thought leadership to chief marketing officers through industry insight, research, and analysis. Our marketing, promotional, and public relations activities are designed to promote Google’s brand image and differentiate it from competitors.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change and converging, as well as new and disruptive, technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with information on the web and provide them with relevant advertising. We face competition from:\n•\nGeneral purpose search engines, such as Yahoo and Microsoft’s Bing.\n•\nVertical search engines and e-commerce websites, such as Kayak (travel queries), Monster.com (job queries), WebMD (for health queries), and Amazon.com and eBay (e-commerce). Some users will navigate directly to such websites rather than go through Google.\n•\nSocial networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. Some users are relying more on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through general purpose search engines.\n•\nOther forms of advertising, such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, and yellow pages, for ad dollars. Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n•\nMobile applications on iPhone and Android devices, which allow users to access information directly from a publisher without using search engines.\n•\nProviders of online products and services. A number of our online products and services, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs, compete directly with new and established companies, which offer communication, information, and entertainment services integrated into their products or media properties.\nWe compete to attract and retain users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, primarily on the basis of the relevance and usefulness of our search results and the features, availability, and ease of use of our products and services.\nWe also compete to attract and retain content providers (Google Network Members, as well as other content providers for whom we distribute or license content), primarily based on the size and quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matter. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nCulture and Employees\nWe take great pride in our culture. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex technical challenges. Transparency and open dialog are central to us, and we like to ensure that company news reaches our employees first through internal channels.\nDespite our rapid growth, we still cherish our roots as a startup and give employees the freedom to act on their ideas regardless of role or function within the company. We strive to hire the best employees, with backgrounds and perspectives as diverse as our global users. We provide an environment where these talented people can have fulfilling careers working on some of the biggest challenges in technology, and have a huge, positive impact on the world.\nAt December 31, 2011, we had 32,467 full-time employees, consisting of 11,665 in research and development, 11,933 in sales and marketing, 4,651 in general and administrative, and 4,218 in operations. All of Google’s full-time employees are also equityholders, with significant collective employee ownership. Although we have works councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our employees are not represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff.\nGlobal Operations and Geographic Data\nWe provide our products and services in more than 100 languages and in more than 50 countries, regions, and territories. On www.google.com or one of our other Google domains, users can find information in many different languages and in many different formats. The United States accounted for approximately 46% of our revenues in 2011. Information regarding financial data by geographic areas is set forth in Item 7 and Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.google.com, and our investor relations website is located at http://investor.google.com. The following filings are available through our investor relations website after we file\nthem with the SEC: Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our Proxy Statements for our annual meetings of stockholders, for the last three years. These filings are also available for download free of charge on our investor relations website. We also provide a link to the section of the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov that has all of our public filings, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, all amendments to those reports, our Proxy Statements, and other ownership related filings. Further, a copy of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is located at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room can be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.\nWe webcast our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host with members of the investment community on our investor relations website. Additionally, we provide notifications of news or announcements regarding our financial performance, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs as part of our investor relations website. Investors and others can receive notifications of new information posted on our investor relations website in real time by signing up for email alerts and RSS feeds. Further corporate governance information, including our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines, board committee charters, and code of conduct, is also available on our investor relations website under the heading “Corporate Governance.” The contents of our websites are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.",
         "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and is subject to changing technology, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. We have many competitors in different industries, including general purpose search engines, vertical search engines and e-commerce sites, social networking sites, traditional media companies, and providers of online products and services. Our current and potential competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Established companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users, and they can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, investing aggressively in research and development, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious) and competing aggressively for advertisers and websites. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can.\nOur success depends on providing products and services that make using the internet a more useful and enjoyable experience for our users. Our competitors are constantly developing innovations in web search, online advertising, and web-based products and services. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our web search technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. If we are unable to provide quality products and services, then our users may become dissatisfied and move to a competitor’s products and services. In addition, these new products and services may present new and difficult technology challenges, and we may be subject to claims if users of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other quality issues. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, and Google Network Members, are not appropriately timed with market\nopportunities, or are not effectively brought to market. As search technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer search results that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, and content providers, our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur ongoing investment in new business strategies and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our ongoing businesses.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new business strategies, products, services, and technologies. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe generate our revenues almost entirely from advertising, and the reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could seriously harm our business.\nWe generated 96% of our revenues in 2011 from our advertisers. Our advertisers can generally terminate their contracts with us at any time. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in advertising with us does not generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, or if we do not deliver their advertisements in an appropriate and effective manner. If we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertisers, they may stop placing ads with us, which would negatively affect our revenues and business.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse economic conditions can have a material negative impact on the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, which could negatively impact our revenues and business.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, the challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, and the increasing maturity of the online advertising market and the other markets in which we participate. We believe our operating margin will experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for many aspects of our business. Our operating margin will also experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our Google Network Members’ websites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on our own websites or if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote the distribution of certain products, including Google Chrome. The margin on revenues we generate from our Google Network Members is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites. Additionally, the margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network Members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google Network Members.\nWe are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business.\nThe growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields implicate a variety of new regulatory issues, and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown. In particular, we are cooperating with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the European Commission (EC) and several state\nattorneys general in investigations they are conducting with respect to our business and its impact on competition. Legislators and regulators, including those conducting investigations in the U.S. and Europe, may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material ways.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust (such as the pending investigations by the FTC and the EC), intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. These proceedings could also result in criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in our business practices, or requiring development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could also adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners.\nThe brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the “Google” brand is critical to expanding our base of users, advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the internet market. Our brand may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including data privacy and security issues, service outages, and product malfunctions. If we fail to maintain and enhance the “Google” brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality products and services, which we may not do successfully.\nAcquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and we expect our current pace of acquisitions to continue. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:\n•\nDiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges.\n•\nImplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.\n•\nIntegration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions.\n•\nTransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.\n•\nFailure to obtain required approvals from governmental authorities under competition and antitrust laws on a timely basis, if it all, which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition.\n•\nIn the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\n•\nFailure to successfully further develop the acquired technology.\n•\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire.\n•\nLiability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.\n•\nLitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\nFuture acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.\nA variety of new and existing U.S. and foreign laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nFurthermore, many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies. The laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. For example, the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the U.S. and abroad. Claims have also been, or may be, threatened and filed against us under both U.S. and foreign laws for defamation, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users, our products and services, or content generated by our users. Moreover, recent amendments to U.S. patent laws will become effective in 2012 and may affect our ability to protect our innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement.\nIn addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for caching or hosting, or for listing or linking to, third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Any future legislation impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact us. Various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to\ncollect information from minors. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California’s Information Practices Act. We face similar risks and costs as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property or other claims, which are costly to defend, could result in significant damage awards, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nInternet, technology, and media companies own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As we have grown, the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies.\nWe have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies, including Android, Google Search, Google AdWords, Google AdSense, Google Books, Google News, Google Image Search, Google Chrome, Google Talk, Google Voice, and YouTube, infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.\nIn addition, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Furthermore, such customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.\nRegardless of the merits of the claims, intellectual property claims are often time consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and cause significant diversion of management attention. To the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful, they may have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective.\nAlthough we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, because of our long-term interests in open source, we may not have adequate patent protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees, which would cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.\nWe also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.\nWe may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.\nWe host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat unsettled both within the U.S. and internationally. Claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright or trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information which we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties, including our users. In addition, we have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we have generated or third-party content that we have made available within our services violates laws in domestic and international jurisdictions.\nWe also arrange for the distribution of third-party advertisements to third-party publishers and advertising networks, and we offer third-party products, services, or content. We may be subject to claims concerning these products, services, or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting, or providing access to them, even if we do not ourselves host, operate, provide, or provide access to these products, services, or content. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources, may result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner.\nMore people are using devices other than personal computers to access the internet. If users do not widely adopt versions of our web search technology, products, or operating systems developed for these devices, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones, smart phones, handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets, video game consoles, and television set-top devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years. The lower resolution, functionality, and memory associated with some alternative devices make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users, manufacturers, or distributors of alternative devices. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. We have limited experience to date in operating versions of our products and services developed or optimized for users of alternative devices, such as Google Mobile and Android, or in designing alternative devices. As new devices and new platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in developing versions of our products and services for use on these alternative devices and we may need to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of such devices. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, distributors, and users to our products and services, or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices, we will fail to capture a significant share of an increasingly important portion of the market for online services, which could adversely affect our business.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services.\nFrom time to time, concerns have been expressed about whether our products and services compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and operating results. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, any failure or perceived failure to comply may result, and has resulted, in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, as nearly all of our products and services are web-based, the amount of data we store for our users on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users’ data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We expect to continue to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based products and services we offer, and operate in more countries.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of users’ and customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. Our security measures may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers.\nWeb spam and content farms could decrease our search quality, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\n“Web spam” refers to websites that attempt to violate a search engine’s quality guidelines or that otherwise seek to rank higher in search results than a search engine’s assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been significantly reduced, and web spam in\nmost other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek ways to improve their rankings inappropriately. We continuously combat web spam, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We have also improved our ability to detect hacked websites, a major source of web spam in 2010. We face new challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including “content farms,” which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. In 2011, we launched several algorithmic changes focused on low-quality websites. If web spam and content farms continue to increase on Google, this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce user traffic to our websites. In addition, as we continue to take actions to improve our search quality and reduce low-quality content, this may in the short run reduce our AdSense revenues, since some of these websites are AdSense partners.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services, or damage to or failure of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services, which could reduce our revenues and profits, and damage our brand.\nOur business and operations are experiencing rapid growth. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed, and will continue to place, significant demands on our management, operational, and financial infrastructure. If we do not effectively manage our growth, the quality of our products and services could suffer, which could negatively affect our brand and operating results. Our expansion and growth in international markets heighten these risks as a result of the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute resolution systems, regulatory systems, and commercial infrastructures. To effectively manage this growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and compliance procedures. These systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and management resources. Failure to implement these improvements could hurt our ability to manage our growth and our consolidated financial position.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks which could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to further expand internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 54% of our total revenues in 2011 and more than half of our user traffic has been coming from outside the U.S. In certain international markets, we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. In addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to additional risks, including the following:\n•\nChanges in local political, economic, social, and labor conditions, which may adversely harm our business.\n•\nRestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.\n•\nImport and export requirements that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market and may increase our operating costs.\n•\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations and our ability to manage these fluctuations through our foreign exchange risk management program.\n•\nLonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.\n•\nUncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent.\n•\nDifferent employee/employer relationships, existence of workers’ councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\nIn addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and antitrust and competition regulations, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nFurthermore, since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net income. Additionally, hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we were to lose the services of Larry, Sergey, Eric, or other key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In particular, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are critical to the overall management of Google and the development of our technology. Along with our Executive Chairman Eric E. Schmidt, they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. Such interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth.\nNew technologies could block our ads, which would harm our business.\nTechnologies have been developed (including by us) that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of our advertising products. Most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages for our users. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.\nGiven the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally. Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely\non our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date, and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this section and the following factors may affect our operating results:\n•\nOur ability to continue to attract users to our websites and satisfy existing users on our websites.\n•\nOur ability to monetize (or generate revenues from) traffic on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites.\n•\nOur ability to attract advertisers to our AdWords program, and our ability to attract websites to our AdSense program.\n•\nThe mix in our revenues between those generated on our websites and those generated through our Google Network.\n•\nThe amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and our ability to manage the resulting risk through our foreign exchange risk management program.\n•\nThe amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure.\n•\nOur focus on long-term goals over short-term results.\n•\nThe results of our investments in risky projects, including new business strategies and new products, services, and technologies.\n•\nOur ability to keep our websites operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions.\n•\nOur ability to generate significant revenues from services in which we have invested considerable time and resources, such as Google Checkout.\nBecause our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results. In addition, advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. Also, user traffic tends to be seasonal. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price for our Class A common stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example, in 2011, the price of our Class A common stock ranged from $473.02 per share to $646.76 per share. The trading price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n•\nQuarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors.\n•\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments.\n•\nRecommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.\n•\nAnnouncements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance on earnings.\n•\nAnnouncements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.\n•\nCommentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other matters affecting our business and results, regardless of its accuracy.\n•\nThe volume of shares of Class A common stock available for public sale.\n•\nSales of stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by our directors, executive officers, and other employees).\n•\nShort sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Class A common stock (including derivative transactions under our TSO program).\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2011, Larry, Sergey, and Eric beneficially owned approximately 92% of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing approximately 66% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Larry, Sergey, and Eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. This concentrated control limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class common stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry, Sergey, and Eric have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial.\n•\nOur board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.\n•\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders’ meeting.\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n•\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n•\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.",

         "ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOur Class A common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since August 19, 2004. Prior to that time, there was no public market for our stock. The following table sets forth for the indicated periods the high and low sales prices per share for our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nOur Class B common stock is neither listed nor traded.\nHolders of Record\nAs of December 31, 2011, there were approximately 2,874 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock, and the closing price of our Class A common stock was $645.90 per share as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. As of December 31, 2011, there were approximately 85 stockholders of record of our Class B common stock.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock. We intend to retain any future earnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nStock Performance Graph\nThis performance graph shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), or incorporated by reference into any filing of Google under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such filing.\nThe following graph shows a comparison from December 31, 2006 through December 31, 2011 of the cumulative total return for our Class A common stock, the S&P 500 Index, the Nasdaq Composite Index, and the RDG Internet Composite Index. Such returns are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance. Data for the S&P 500 Index, the Nasdaq Composite Index, and the RDG Internet Composite Index assume reinvestment of dividends.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nGoogle is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. Our innovations in web search and advertising have made our website a top internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. We serve three primary constituencies:\n•\nUsers. We provide users with products and services that enable people to more quickly and easily find, create, and organize information that is useful to them.\n•\nAdvertisers. We provide advertisers with cost-effective ways to deliver online and offline ads to customers across Google-owned websites and through the Google Network, which is the network of third parties that use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads with their search results and content.\n•\nGoogle Network Members and Other Content Providers. We provide members of our Google Network with our Google AdSense programs. These include programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on the websites of our Google Network Members. We share most of the fees these ads generate with our Google Network Members, thereby creating an important revenue stream for them. In addition, we have entered into arrangements with other content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content, and we may display ads next to or as part of this content on the pages of our websites. We share most of the fees these ads generate with these content providers, thereby creating an important revenue stream for these partners.\nRecent Development\nOn August 15, 2011, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Motorola, a provider of innovative technologies, products and services that enable a range of mobile and wireline digital communication, information and entertainment experiences, under which we will acquire Motorola for $40 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $12.5 billion in cash. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals.\nHow We Generate Revenue\nAdvertising revenues made up 97% of our revenues in 2009 and 96% of our revenues in 2010 and 2011. We derive most of our additional revenues from our enterprise products, as well as our display advertising management services to advertisers, ad agencies, and publishers.\nGoogle AdWords is our auction-based advertising program that enables advertisers to place text-based and display ads on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites. Display advertising comprises the videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets. Most of our AdWords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites as specified by the advertisers. For advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-click pricing, we recognize as revenue the fees charged to advertisers\neach time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results or content on our websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. For advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-impression pricing, we recognize as revenue the fees charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on our websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. Our AdWords agreements are generally terminable at any time by our advertisers.\nGoogle AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on our Google Network Members’ websites, as well as programs to deliver ads on television broadcasts. Our AdSense programs include AdSense for search and AdSense for content.\nAdSense for search is our online service for distributing relevant ads from our advertisers for display with search results on our Google Network Members’ websites. To use AdSense for search, most of our AdSense for search partners add Google search functionality to their web pages in the form of customizable Google search boxes. When visitors to these websites search either the website or the internet using these customizable search boxes, we display relevant ads on the search results pages, targeted to match user search queries. Ads shown through AdSense for search are text ads.\nAdSense for content is our online service for distributing ads from our advertisers that are relevant to content on our Google Network Members’ websites. Under this program, we use automated technology to analyze the meaning of the content on the web page and serve relevant ads based on the meaning of such content. For example, a web page on an automotive blog that contains an entry about vintage cars might display ads for vintage car parts or vintage car shows. These ads are displayed in spaces that our AdSense for content partners have set aside on their websites. AdSense for content allows a variety of ad types to be shown, including text ads, image ads, Google Video Ads, link units (which are sets of clickable links to topic pages related to page content), themed units (which are regular text ads with graphic treatments that change seasonally and by geography), and gadget ads (which are customized “mini-sites” that run as ads on AdSense publisher websites).\nFor our online AdSense program, our advertisers pay us a fee each time a user clicks on one of our advertisers’ ads displayed on our Google Network Members’ websites or, for those advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression pricing, as their ads are displayed. To date, we have paid most of these advertiser fees to our Google Network Members, and we expect to continue doing so for the foreseeable future. We recognize these advertiser fees as revenue and the portion of the advertiser fee we pay to our Google Network Members as traffic acquisition costs under cost of revenues. Google Network Members do not pay any fees associated with the use of our AdSense program on their websites.\nOur agreements with Google Network Members consist largely of uniform online “click-wrap” agreements that members enter into by interacting with our registration websites. The standard agreements have no stated term and are terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both the standard agreements and the negotiated agreements require us to share with the Google Network Member most of the advertiser fees generated by users clicking on ads on the Google Network Member’s website or, for advertisers who choose our cost-per-impression pricing, as the ads are displayed on the Google Network Member’s website. For example, under our standard agreements, we pay 51% and 68% of the fees collected from advertisers to our Google Network Members in AdSense for search and AdSense for content, respectively.\nWe also offer display advertising management services such as media planning, buying, implementation, and measurement tools for advertisers and agencies, and forecasting and reporting tools for publishers. We recognize the related fees as other revenues in the period advertising impressions are delivered.\nIn January 2010, we launched, and in July 2010, we discontinued, our direct-to-consumer web store channel for distributing our Nexus One mobile phone. We had recognized fees derived from the sale of these phones as other revenues in the period in which they were delivered.\nWe have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. Our agreements with content providers are typically standard agreements with no stated\nterm and are terminable at will. Agreements with our larger members are individually negotiated. Both the standard agreements and the negotiated agreements require us to pay the content providers for the content we license. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our websites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers. We recognize these advertiser fees as revenue and the fees we pay to our content providers as content acquisition costs under cost of revenues.\nWe believe the factors that influence the success of our advertising programs include the following:\n•\nThe relevance, objectivity, and quality of our search results and the relevance and quality of ads displayed with each search results page.\n•\nThe number of searches initiated at our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites and the underlying purpose of these searches (for instance, whether they are for academic research, to find a news article, or to find a product or service).\n•\nThe number and prominence of ads displayed on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites.\n•\nThe number of visits to, and the content of, our Google Network Members’ websites and certain of our websites and the relevance and quality of the ads we display next to this content.\n•\nThe advertisers’ return on investment from advertising campaigns on our websites or our Google Network Members’ websites compared to other forms of advertising.\n•\nThe total advertising spending budgets of each advertiser.\n•\nThe number of advertisers and the breadth of items advertised.\n•\nThe amount we ultimately pay our Google Network Members, distribution partners, and our content providers for traffic, access points, and content, compared to the amount of revenues we generate.\n•\nOur ability to increase traffic on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites via new and improved ad formats including the ones on mobile devices.\nTrends in Our Business\nAdvertising transactions continue to shift from offline to online as the digital economy evolves. This has contributed to the rapid growth of our business since inception, resulting in substantially increased revenues, and we expect that our business will continue to grow. However, our revenue growth rate has generally declined over time, and it could do so in the future as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, and increasing maturity of the online advertising market and other markets in which we participate. In addition, if there is a further general economic downturn, this may result in fewer commercial queries by our users and may cause advertisers to reduce the amount they spend on online advertising, including the amount they are willing to pay for each click or impression, which could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues. We plan to continue to invest aggressively in our core areas of strategic focus.\nThe main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to our users, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites. These steps include not displaying ads that generate low click-through rates or that send users to irrelevant or otherwise low quality websites and terminating our relationships with those Google Network Members whose websites do not meet our quality requirements. We may also continue to take steps to reduce the number of accidental clicks by our users. These steps could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues.\nBoth seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial\nqueries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenues, as well as aggregate paid click and average cost-per-click growth rates.\nThe operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our Google Network Members’ websites through our AdSense program is significantly lower than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from ads placed on our websites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on Google Network Members’ websites are shared with our Google Network Members. For the past five years, growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from our Google Network Members’ websites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future, although the relative rate of growth in revenues from our websites compared to the rate of growth in revenues from our Google Network Members’ websites may vary over time.\nWe also continue to invest aggressively in our systems, data centers, corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure, and employees. We increased our hiring in 2011, and we may continue to do so and to provide competitive compensation programs for our employees. For instance, effective January 1, 2011, we increased base salaries for all of our non-executive employees by 10% and shifted a portion of the bonus into base salary. Our full-time employee headcount was 24,400 at December 31, 2010 and 32,467 at December 31, 2011. Acquisitions will also remain an important component of our strategy and use of capital, and we expect our current pace of acquisitions to continue. We expect our cost of revenues will increase in dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees, and other costs. In particular, traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may increase in the future if we are unable to continue to improve the monetization or generation of revenues from traffic on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites.\nAs we expand our advertising programs and other products to international markets, we continue to increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates. We have a foreign exchange risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. However, this program will not fully offset the effect of fluctuations on our revenues and earnings.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our historical operating results as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated:\nRevenues\nThe following table presents our revenues, by revenue source, for the periods presented (in millions):\nThe following table presents our revenues, by revenue source, as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented:\nThe increase in our revenues from 2010 to 2011 resulted primarily from an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites. The increase in advertising revenues for Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic, certain monetization improvements including new ad formats, and the continued global expansion of our products, and our advertiser and user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network Members. The increase in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was primarily driven by the increased spending from advertisers and a general weakening of the U.S dollar compared to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro, Japanese yen, and British pound), partially offset by the changes in geographical mix due to traffic growth in emerging markets, where the average cost-per-click is typically lower, compared to more mature markets. In addition, the increase in advertising revenues for Google Network Members’ websites from 2010 to 2011 was partially offset by the loss of a search partnership and, to a lesser extent, by a search quality improvement made during the first quarter of 2011.\nThe increase in our revenues from 2009 to 2010 resulted primarily from an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites and, to a lesser extent, an increase in other revenues, largely as a result of the launch of our mobile phone business in the first quarter of 2010. The increase in advertising revenue for Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites from 2009 to 2010 resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic, certain monetization improvements, including new ad formats, and the continued global expansion of our products, and our advertiser and user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network Members. The increase in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was primarily driven by the increased spending from advertisers, partially offset by the changes in geographical mix due to traffic growth in emerging markets, where the average cost-per-click is typically lower, compared to more mature markets.\nImprovements in our ability to ultimately monetize increased traffic primarily relate to enhancing the end user experience, including providing end users with ads that are more relevant to their search queries or to the content on the Google Network Members’ websites they visit. For instance, these improvements include increasing site links to be full size links with the URL (uniform resource locator), moving a portion of the first line of the ad to the heading to better promote the content of the ad, providing an option to preview the ad, and moving the ad’s URL to a separate line below the heading for greater page format consistency.\nAggregate paid clicks on Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites increased approximately 25% from 2010 to 2011 and approximately 16% from 2009 to 2010. Average cost-per-click on Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites increased approximately 3% from 2010 to 2011 and 5% from 2009 to 2010. The rate of change in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click, and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors, including the revenue growth rates on our websites compared to those of our Google Network Members, advertiser competition for keywords, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, seasonality, the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs, changes in advertising quality or formats, and general economic conditions. In addition, traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels also contributes to these fluctuations. Changes in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click may not be indicative of our performance or advertiser experiences in any specific geographic market, vertical, or industry.\nWe believe that the increase in the number of paid clicks on Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites is substantially the result of our commitment to improving the relevance and quality of both our search results and the advertisements displayed, which we believe results in a better user experience, which in turn results in more searches, advertisers, and Google Network Members and other partners.\nRevenues by Geography\nThe following table presents our domestic and international revenues as a percentage of consolidated revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our customers:\nThe growth in international revenues (other than the United Kingdom) as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2010 to 2011 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs, our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products for these international markets, and, to a lesser extent, a general weakening of the U.S dollar compared to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and Japanese yen).\nThe growth in international revenues (other than the United Kingdom) as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2009 to 2010 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs and our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products for these international markets. The growth in revenues from the United States as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2009 to 2010 resulted largely from the recovery of certain key verticals such as retail, travel, finance, and insurance. The decline in revenues from the United Kingdom as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2009 to 2010 resulted primarily from a less robust economic recovery relative to the United States and the rest of the world, as well as a decrease in hedging gains recognized during 2010.\nThe general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Euro, Japanese yen, and British pound) from 2010 to 2011 had a favorable impact on our international revenues. Had foreign\nexchange rates remained constant in these periods, our revenues from the United Kingdom would have been $129 million, or 3.2%, lower and our revenues from the rest of the world would have been approximately $834 million, or 5.1%, lower in 2011. This is before consideration of hedging gains of $9 million and $34 million recognized to revenues from the United Kingdom and the rest of the world in 2011.\nThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) from 2009 to 2010 had an unfavorable impact on our international revenues. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our revenues from the United Kingdom would have been approximately $10 million, or 0.3% higher, and our revenues from the rest of the world would have been approximately $25 million, or 0.2% higher in 2010. This is before consideration of hedging gains of $42 million and $161 million recognized to revenues from the United Kingdom and the rest of the world in 2010.\nAlthough we expect to continue to make investments in international markets, these investments may not result in an increase in our international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2012 or thereafter. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about geographic areas.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately paid to our Google Network Members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search queries to our website (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share and fixed fee arrangements with our Google Network Members and distribution partners.\nCertain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not exclusively-or at all-based on revenue share. These fees are non-refundable. Further, these arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. We recognize fees under these arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points (approximately two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year, or based on any contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenues.\nCost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions including Google Checkout transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as content acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our websites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers. To the extent we are obligated to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to our content providers, we recognize as content acquisition costs the contractual revenue share amount or on a straight-line basis, whichever is greater, over the terms of the agreements.\nThe following tables present our cost of revenues and cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, and our traffic acquisition costs, and traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues, for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nCost of revenues increased $2,771 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase was primarily related to an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $1,132 million resulting from more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program. The increase was also related to an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $362 million from our distribution arrangements as a result of more traffic directed to our websites, as well as more distribution fees paid. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of advertising revenues from our websites compared to our Google Network Members’ websites, more revenues realized from Google Network Members to whom we pay less revenue share, and, to a lesser extent, expiration of an AdSense arrangement under which we paid guaranteed minimum revenue share. In addition, there was an increase in data center costs of $784 million, primarily resulting from the depreciation of additional information technology assets and data center buildings and an increase in labor, energy, and bandwidth costs, and an increase in content acquisition costs of $236 million, primarily related to content displayed on YouTube, partially offset by a decrease in mobile phone costs.\nCost of revenues increased $1,573 million from 2009 to 2010. The increase was primarily related to an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $897 million resulting largely from more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program. The increase was also related to an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $251 million from our distribution arrangements as a result of more traffic directed to our websites, as well as more distribution fees paid. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily due to more revenues realized from Google Network Members to whom we pay less revenue share, and expiration of an AdSense arrangement under which we paid guaranteed minimum revenue share. In addition, there was an increase in content acquisition costs of $169 million primarily related to content displayed on YouTube and an increase in mobile phone costs.\nWe expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2012 and in future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, credit card and other transaction fees, content acquisition costs, and other costs. Traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors, including the following:\n•\nThe relative growth rates of revenues from our websites and from our Google Network Members’ websites.\n•\nWhether we are able to enter into more AdSense arrangements that provide for lower revenue share obligations or whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential Google Network Members results in less favorable revenue share arrangements.\n•\nWhether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites.\n•\nThe relative growth rates of expenses associated with distribution arrangements and the related revenues generated, including whether we share with certain existing and new distribution partners proportionately more of the aggregate advertising fees that we earn from paid clicks derived from search queries these partners direct to our websites.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents our research and development expenses, and research and development expenses as a percentage of our revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel responsible for the research and development of new and existing products and services. We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.\nResearch and development expenses increased $1,400 million from 2010 to 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $875 million, largely as a result of a 23% increase in research and development headcount, including headcount from acquisitions, as well as an increase in employee base salaries of approximately 10%. In addition, there was an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $200 million.\nResearch and development expenses increased $919 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor-related costs of $578 million, largely as a result of a 28% increase in research and development headcount, including headcount from acquisitions. In addition, there was an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $136 million.\nWe expect that research and development expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2012 and future periods because we expect to continue to invest in building the necessary employee and systems infrastructures required to support the development of new, and improve existing, products and services.\nSales and Marketing\nThe following table presents our sales and marketing expenses, and sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel engaged in customer service, sales, and sales support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenditures.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1,790 million from 2010 to 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $787 million, largely as a result of a 36% increase in sales and marketing headcount, including headcount from acquisitions, as well as an increase in employee base salaries of approximately 10%. In addition, there was an increase in advertising and promotional expense of $700 million.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $815 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expense of $387 million. In addition, there was an increase in labor-related costs of $254 million, largely as a result of a 20% increase in sales and marketing headcount, and higher commission expense.\nWe expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2012 and future periods, as we expand our business globally, increase advertising and promotional expenditures in connection with new and existing products, and increase the level of service we provide to our advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe following table presents our general and administrative expenses, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel and facilities, and include costs related to our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, and legal organizations, and fees for professional services. Professional services are principally comprised of outside legal, audit, information technology consulting, and outsourcing services.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $762 million from 2010 to 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $350 million, primarily as a result of a 37% increase in general and administrative headcount and an increase in employee base salaries of approximately 10%, as well as an increase in expense related to professional services of $260 million, the majority of which were related to consulting services and legal costs. In addition, there was an increase in stock-based compensation of $116 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $294 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was primarily due to increases in expense related to professional services of $137 million, the majority of which were related to legal and temporary services costs. In addition, there was an increase in labor-related costs of $64 million largely as a result of a 14% increase in general and administrative headcount, and an increase in charitable contributions of $64 million.\nAs we expand our business and incur additional expenses, we expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2012 and future periods.\nCharge Related to the Resolution of Department of Justice Investigation\nIn connection with a resolution of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice into the use of Google advertising by certain advertisers, we accrued $500 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011, which was paid in August 2011 upon final resolution of that matter.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table presents our stock-based compensation, and stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nStock-based compensation increased $598 million from 2010 to 2011. This increase was largely due to additional stock awards issued to existing and new employees.\nStock-based compensation increased $212 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was largely due to additional stock awards issued to existing and new employees.\nWe estimate stock-based compensation to be approximately $2.0 billion in 2012 and $2.4 billion thereafter. This estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after December 31, 2011 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. In addition, to the extent forfeiture rates are different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nInterest and Other Income, Net\nInterest and other income, net increased $169 million from 2010 to 2011. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest income of $233 million due to an increase in our cash and investment balances and higher yields, as well as an increase in net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale investments of $69 million, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $53 million primarily related to our long-term debt program. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of $110 million related to certain equity investments during the year ended December 31, 2011.\nInterest and other income, net increased $346 million from 2009 to 2010. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest income of $349 million due to an increase in our cash and investment balances and higher yields, as well as an increase in net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale investments of $88 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase in net foreign exchange related costs of $95 million primarily related to our foreign exchange risk management program.\nThe costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities that we recognized to interest and other income, net are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts, as well as the volatility of the foreign exchange rates.\nAs we expand our international business, we believe costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program may increase in dollar amount in 2012 and future periods.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for income taxes, and effective tax rate for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nOur provision for income taxes increased from 2010 to 2011, primarily as a result of increases in federal income taxes, driven by higher taxable income year over year, partially offset by proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate decreased from 2010 to 2011, primarily as a result of proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates, a decrease in state income taxes, and an increase in federal research and development credits recognized in 2011, partially offset by recognition of a charge related to the resolution of an investigation by the Department of Justice which is not deductible for tax purposes.\nOur provision for income taxes increased from 2009 to 2010, primarily as a result of increases in federal and state income taxes, driven by higher taxable income year over year. Our effective tax rate decreased from 2009 to 2010, primarily because we released certain tax reserves as a result of the settlement of our 2005 and 2006 tax audits in 2010. This decrease was partially offset by proportionately higher earnings in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nOur effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. Our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional information about our provision for income taxes.\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nYou should read the following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. You should also keep in mind that our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2011. This table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2011:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn summary, our cash flows are as follows (in millions):\nAt December 31, 2011, we had $44.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, and municipalities in the U.S., corporate securities, and mortgage-backed securities.\nAs of December 31, 2011, $21.2 billion of the $44.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. At December 31, 2011, we had unused letters of credit for approximately $46 million. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. In addition, we may make acquisitions or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund any such acquisitions and licensing activities. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2011, we had $750 million of commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.1%. Average commercial paper borrowings during the year were $1.4 billion and the maximum amount outstanding during the year was $3.0 billion. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2011.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2011, we had a $468 million secured promissory note outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with an interest rate of 1.0% that matures in December 2012.\nIn May 2011, we issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three equal tranches, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021, with stated interest rates of 1.25%, 2.125%, and 3.625%. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2011, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of these notes were $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of December 31, 2011. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the notes. During 2011, we paid $35 million in interest payments related to these notes.\nIn August 2011, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Motorola, a provider of innovative technologies, products and services that enable a range of mobile and wireline digital communication, information and entertainment experiences, under which we will acquire Motorola for $40 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $12.5 billion. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated due to a failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals, we would be required to pay Motorola a fee of $2.5 billion. The transaction is currently expected to close in early 2012.\nCash provided by operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including amortization, depreciation, deferred income taxes, excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities, stock-based compensation expense, and impairment of equity investments, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities. Cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was $14,565 million and consisted of net income of $9,737 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $4,198 million, and cash provided by working capital and other activities of $630 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,974 million of stock-based compensation expense, $1,396 million of depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment, $455 million of amortization of intangible and other assets, $343 million of deferred income taxes, and $110 million related to impairment of equity investments. In addition, the increase in cash from changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $795 million, a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $731 million, an increase in accrued revenue share of $259 million, an increase of $162 million in deferred revenue, and an increase of $101 million in accounts payable. These increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $1,156 million due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers, and an increase in prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets of $262 million. The increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes reflected primarily additional tax obligations accrued, partially offset by estimated income taxes paid during 2011. In addition, we paid $500 million related to the resolution of a Department of Justice investigation during the year.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2010 was $11,081 million, and consisted of net income of $8,505 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $2,675 million, and cash used in working capital and other activities of $99 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,376 million of stock-based compensation expense, $1,067 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, and $329 million of amortization of intangible and other assets, partially offset by $94 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based\naward activities. In addition, the decrease in cash from changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of an increase of $1,129 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers and an increase of $414 million in prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets. These increases were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $745 million, an increase in accounts payable of $272 million, an increase in accrued revenue share of $214 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $111 million, and a net increase in income tax payable and deferred income taxes of $102 million, which includes the same $94 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities included under adjustments for non-cash items. The increase in accrued expense and other liabilities, accounts payable, accrued revenue share, and deferred revenues are primarily a result of the growth in our business and headcount. The increase in net income taxes payable and deferred income taxes was primarily a result of additional tax obligations accrued, partially offset by the release of certain tax reserves as a result of the settlement of our tax audits for our 2005 and 2006 tax years.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2009 was $9,316 million, and consisted of net income of $6,520 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $2,310 million, and cash provided by working capital and other activities of $486 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,240 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, $1,164 million of stock-based compensation expense, and $284 million of amortization of intangible and other assets, partially offset by $268 million of deferred income taxes on earnings and $90 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities. In addition, changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of a decrease of $262 million in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $243 million which is a direct result of the growth of our business, and a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $217 million, which includes the same $90 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities included under adjustments for non-cash items, and an increase in accrued revenue share of $158 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase of $504 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers. The increase in net income taxes payable and deferred income taxes was primarily a result of additional tax obligations accrued, partially offset by an increase in the amount of estimated income taxes we paid during the year. The increase in accrued revenue share was due to the growth in our AdSense and distribution programs and the timing of payments made to our partners.\nAs we expand our business internationally, we have offered payment terms to certain advertisers that are standard in their locales but longer than terms we would generally offer to our domestic advertisers. This may increase our working capital requirements and may have a negative effect on cash provided by our operating activities.\nCash used in investing activities in 2011 of $19,041 million was primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of $12,926 million, capital expenditures of $3,438 million related principally to our facilities, data centers, and related equipment, and cash consideration used in acquisitions and other investments of $2,328 million, including $676 million paid in connection with the acquisition of ITA. Also, in connection with our securities lending program, we returned $354 million of cash collateral. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about our securities lending program.\nCash used in investing activities in 2010 of $10,680 million was primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of $6,886 million, capital expenditures of $4,018 million of which $1.8 billion was for the purchase of an office building in New York City in December 2010, and remaining amounts related principally to our data centers and related equipment, and cash consideration used in acquisitions and other investments of $1,067 million. Also, in connection with our securities lending program, we received $2,361 million of cash collateral which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements. Of the $2,361 million, $1,611 million was classified as cash and cash equivalents, and $750 million was classified as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCash used in investing activities in 2009 of $8,019 million was primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of $7,036 million and capital expenditures of $810 million.\nIn order to manage expected increases in internet traffic, advertising transactions, and new products and services, and to support our overall global business expansion, we expect to make significant investments in our systems, data centers, corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure, and employees in 2012 and thereafter. However, the amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis.\nIn addition, we expect to spend a significant amount of cash on acquisitions and other investments from time to time. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product offerings.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2011 of $807 million was primarily driven by net proceeds of $726 million of debt issued and excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities of $86 million.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2010 of $3,050 million was primarily driven by $3,463 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and a promissory note. This was partially offset by $801 million in stock repurchases in connection with our acquisitions of AdMob and On2 Technologies, Inc., as well as net proceeds from stock-based award activities of $294 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities of $94 million.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2009 of $233 million was primarily due to net proceeds related to stock-based award activities of $143 million. In addition, there were excess tax benefits of $90 million from stock-based award activities during the period which represented a portion of the $260 million reduction to income taxes payable that we recorded in 2009 related to the total direct tax benefit realized from the exercise, sale, or vesting of these awards.\nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2011\nThe above table does not include future rental income of $726 million related to the leases that we assumed in connection with our building purchases.\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring primarily between 2012 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the above table. Certain of these leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases have adjustments for market provisions.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations represent non-cancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 2011. These contracts are primarily related to distribution arrangements, video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, as well as data center operations and facility build-outs. In addition, we had $2.8 billion of open purchase orders for which we have not received the related services or goods at December 31, 2011. This amount is not included in the above table because we have the right to cancel the purchase orders prior to the date of delivery.\nLong-term Debt Obligations\nLong-term debt obligations represent principal and interest payments to be made over the life of our unsecured senior notes issued in May 2011. Please see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities consist of cash obligations, primarily the legal settlement with the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers (AAP), and milestone and royalty payments owed in connection with certain acquisitions and licensing agreements.\nIn addition to the amounts above, we recorded additional long-term taxes payable of $438 million in 2011 related to tax positions for which the timing of the ultimate resolution is uncertain. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table.\nOff-Balance Sheet Entities\nAt December 31, 2011, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nAlthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.\nOur effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, state taxes, certain benefits realized related to stock-based award activities, and research and experimentation tax credits. The effective tax rates were 22.2%, 21.2%, and 21.0% for 2009, 2010, and 2011. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur stock-based compensation expense for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the award’s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and expected term. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model changes significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and our expectations regarding future pre-vesting termination behavior of employees. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our marketable securities and our non-marketable equity securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment,\nthe reason for the decline in value, the potential recovery period, and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the investment before recovery. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. In addition, in December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement. We adopted both standards in the fourth quarter of 2011.\nIn September 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard, which provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing on goodwill is necessary. Specifically, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. This standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2012 and the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn May 2011, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update, which amends the fair value measurement guidance and includes some enhanced disclosure requirements. The most significant change in disclosures is an expansion of the information required for Level 3 measurements based on unobservable inputs. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2012 and the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.",
         "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nEconomic Exposure\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues, as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We purchase foreign exchange option contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The gain on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest and other income, net, if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring. Any gain after a hedge is de-designated or related to an ineffective portion of a hedge is recognized as interest and other income, net, immediately.\nAt December 31, 2010, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros were 3.0 billion (or approximately $4.1 billion) and $227 million; the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds were £1.5 billion (or approximately $2.3 billion) and $97 million; and the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars were C$407 million (or approximately $382 million) and $6 million. At\nDecember 31, 2011, the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros were 2.8 billion (or approximately $3.8 billion) and $232 million; the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds were £1.4 billion (or approximately $2.2 billion) and $80 million; and the notional principal and fair value of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars were C$504 million (or approximately $490 million) and $17 million. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 36 months or less. We may enter into similar contracts in other foreign currencies in the future.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% for our foreign currencies instruments could be experienced in the near term.\nIf the U.S. dollar weakened by 20%, the amount recorded in AOCI before tax effect would have been approximately $140 million and $132 million lower at December 31, 2010 and 2011, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest and other income, net, would have been approximately $134 million and $138 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20%, the amount recorded in accumulated AOCI before tax effect would have been approximately $1.2 billion higher at both December 31, 2010 and 2011, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest and other income, net, would have been approximately $175 million and $202 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011.\nTransaction Exposure\nOur exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary, primarily the Euro and the British pound. Our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency. We have entered into foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary.\nThe notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $1.0 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and 2011. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars for foreign currencies was $84 million and $472 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with other foreign currencies was 991 million (or approximately $1.3 billion) and 711 million (or approximately $929 million) at December 31, 2010 and 2011. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros for other foreign currencies was 6 million (or approximately $8 million) at December 31, 2010 and no such contracts were outstanding at December 31, 2011.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $20 million and $27 million at December 31, 2010 and 2011. The adverse impact at December 31, 2010 and 2011 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $467 million and $503 million from foreign exchange contracts in place for the months of December 2010 and December 2011. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, time deposits, money market and other funds, mortgage-backed securities, and corporate debt securities. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.\nInvestments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our income from investments may decrease in the future. However, we use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate risk of our fixed income securities.\nWe considered the historical volatility of short-term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable securities of approximately $895 million and $934 million at December 31, 2010 and 2011, after taking into consideration the offsetting effect from interest rate derivative contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2011.",
         "ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nGoogle Inc.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nFinancial Statements:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe supplementary financial information required by this Item 8 is included in Item 7 under the caption “Quarterly Results of Operations.”\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Google Inc.\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Google Inc. at December 31, 2010 and 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated January 26, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 26, 2012\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Google Inc.\nWe have audited Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Google Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, Google Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 of Google Inc. and our report dated January 26, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 26, 2012\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except share and par value amounts which are reflected in thousands,\nand par value per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(In millions, except for share amounts which are reflected in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Google Inc. and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nWe were incorporated in California in September 1998. We were re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Google Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table presents our revenues by revenue source (in millions):\nGoogle AdWords is our auction-based advertising program that enables advertisers to place text-based and display ads on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites. Display advertising comprises the videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets. Most of our AdWords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites as specified by the advertisers.\nGoogle AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on our Google Network Members’ websites, as well as programs to deliver ads on television broadcasts.\nWe recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results or content on our websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. For those advertisers using our AdWords cost-per-impression pricing, we recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on our websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. We report our Google AdSense revenues on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisers.\nWe recognize revenues when the services or products have been provided or delivered, the fees we charge are fixed or determinable, we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nWe record deferred revenue upon invoicing or when cash payments are received in advance of our performance in the underlying agreement on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately paid to our Google Network members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search queries to our website (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share and fixed fee arrangements with our Google Network Members and distribution partners.\nCertain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not exclusively-or at all-based on revenue share. These fees are non-refundable. Further, these arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. We recognize fees under these arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points (approximately two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year, or based on any contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenues. Further, we review the access points for impairment by distribution partner, type, and geography, and we have not made any impairment to date.\nPrepaid revenue share and distribution fees are included in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions including Google Checkout transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as content acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our web sites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers. To the extent we are obligated to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to our content providers, we recognize as content acquisition costs the contractual revenue share amount or on a straight-line basis, whichever is greater, over the terms of the agreements.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe have elected to use the BSM option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. Shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of RSUs outstanding. Furthermore, we record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us as a reduction to additional paid-in capital when paid. Also, we recognize stock-based compensation using the straight-line method.\nWe include as part of cash flows from financing activities the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax-effected compensation of the related stock-based awards for options exercised and RSUs vested during the period. During the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2011, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $350 million, $656 million, and $621 million, and the total direct tax benefit realized, including the excess tax benefit, from stock-based award activities was $260 million, $355 million, and $451 million. We have elected to account for the indirect effects of stock-based awards-primarily the research and development tax credit-through the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2011, we recognized stock-based compensation and related tax benefits of $1,164 million and $264 million, $1,376 million and $314 million, and $1,974 million and $413 million.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nOur revenues are principally derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, our revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the world. Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, mortgage-backed securities, corporate securities, time deposits, and money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. In 2009, 2010, and 2011, we generated approximately 47%, 48%, and 46% of our revenues from customers based in the U.S., with the majority of customers outside of the U.S. located in Europe and Japan. Many of our Google Network Members are in the internet industry. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend, but generally we do not require collateral from our customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations.\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2009, 2010, and 2011.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of our financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, short-term debt, and accrued liabilities, approximate fair value because of their generally short maturities.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nWe invest our excess cash primarily in highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, municipalities in the U.S., debt instruments issued by foreign governments, mortgage-backed securities, corporate securities, time deposits, and money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program. We classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities.\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as available-for-sale. We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than\n12 months until maturity. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other-than-temporary, which we record as interest and other income, net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of interest and other income, net.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe have accounted for non-marketable equity securities primarily at cost because we do not have significant influence over the underlying investees.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our marketable securities, as well as our non-marketable equity securities, for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period, and our intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, the investment before recovery. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and take a corresponding charge to our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we do not charge interest. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers. We determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. We depreciate buildings over periods up to 25 years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property (including land) and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. Depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed to external users, before technological feasibility of such products is reached. We have determined that technological feasibility was reached shortly before the release of those products and as a result, the development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before the release of those products were not material, and accordingly, were expensed as incurred.\nLong-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review property and equipment and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. We have made no material adjustments to our long-lived assets in any of the years presented. In addition, we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired. Our tests are based on our single operating segment and reporting unit structure. We found no goodwill impairment in any of the years presented.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one to 12 years.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize income taxes under the liability method. We recognize deferred income taxes for differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity. We recorded $77 million of net translation gains in 2009, $124 million of net translation losses in 2010, and $107 million of net translation losses in 2011. We record net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions as a component of interest and other income, net. These gains and losses are net of those realized on foreign exchange contracts. We recorded $8 million of net gains in 2009, $29 million of net losses in 2010, and $38 million of net losses in 2011.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2011, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $353 million, $772 million, and $1,544 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which requires companies to present net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate, but consecutive, statements. In addition, in December 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which defers the requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement. We adopted both standards in the fourth quarter of 2011.\nIn September 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard, which provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing on goodwill is necessary. Specifically, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative\nimpairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. This standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2012 and the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn May 2011, the FASB issued a new accounting standard update, which amends the fair value measurement guidance and includes some enhanced disclosure requirements. The most significant change in disclosures is an expansion of the information required for Level 3 measurements based on unobservable inputs. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. We adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2012 and the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.\nNote 2. Net Income Per Share of Class A and Class B Common Stock\nWe compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period except that it does not include unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options, warrants issued under the TSO program, restricted shares, restricted stock units, and unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, warrants, restricted shares, and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Further, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock (in this case the right of our Class A common stock to receive an equal dividend to any declared on our Class B common stock) must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):\nThe net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.\nNote 3. Cash and Investments\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities consisted of the following (in millions):\n(1) The balances at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011 included $1.6 billion and $1.3 billion of cash collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months. See below for further discussion on this program.\nThe following tables summarize unrealized gains and losses related to our investments in marketable securities designated as available-for-sale (in millions):\nGross unrealized gains and losses on cash equivalents were not material at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011.\nWe recognized gross realized gains of $212 million and $381 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011. We recognized gross realized losses of $27 million and $127 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2011. We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we reflect such gains and losses as a component of interest and other income, net, in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable securities, excluding the marketable equity securities, designated as available-for-sale and classified by the contractual maturity date of the securities (in millions):\nThe following tables present gross unrealized losses and fair values for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2010 and 2011, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2010, we did not have any investments in marketable securities that were in an unrealized loss position for 12 months or greater.\nInvestment in a Marketable Equity Security\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2011, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $88 million related to our investment in Clearwire Corporation. This amount was included in interest and other income, net in the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Income.\nSecurities Lending Program\nFrom time to time, we enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income. We loan selected securities which are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities. Cash collateral is invested in reverse repurchase agreements. We classify loaned securities as cash equivalents or marketable securities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record the cash collateral as an asset with a corresponding liability. We classify reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months as cash equivalents and those longer than three months as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For lending agreements collateralized by securities, we do not record an asset or liability as we are not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral.\nNote 4. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2010 and 2011, we had $3.0 billion and $750 million of commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt with weighted-average interest rates of 0.3% and 0.1%. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. At December 31, 2010 and 2011, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility. No amounts were outstanding under the credit facility at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011.\nIn December 2010, we issued a secured promissory note in the amount of $468 million with an interest rate of 1.0% and a one-year maturity date. Proceeds were used for the acquisition of an office building in New York City. In December 2011, we extended the maturity date of the note to December 2012. As of December 31, 2010 and 2011, the outstanding balance was $468 million.\nThe estimated fair value of the short-term debt approximated its carrying value at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011.\nLong-Term Debt\nIn May 2011, we issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three tranches as described in the table below (collectively, the Notes) (in millions):\nThe effective interest yields of the 2014, 2016, and 2021 Notes were 1.258%, 2.241%, and 3.734%, respectively. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 19 and November 19 of each year. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole or from time to time in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. The total estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $3.2 billion, which is based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of December 31, 2011.\nAt December 31, 2011, future principal payments for the Notes were as follows (in millions):\nNote 5. Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities. Our program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as interest and other income, net, as part of revenues, or to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe use options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We initially report any gain on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify to revenues when the hedged revenues are\nrecorded or as interest and other income, net, if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring. Further, we exclude the change in the time value of the options from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We record the premium paid or time value of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter, we recognize any change to this time value in interest and other income, net.\nAt December 31, 2011, the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was $154 million, of which $127 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI to revenues within the next 12 months.\nThe notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Euros was 3.0 billion (or approximately $4.1 billion) and 2.8 billion (or approximately $3.8 billion) at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011; the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with British pounds was £1.5 billion (or approximately $2.3 billion) and £1.4 billion (or approximately $2.2 billion) at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011; and the notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with Canadian dollars was C$407 million (or approximately $382 million) and C$504 million (or approximately $490 million) at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 36 months or less.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in interest and other income, net, along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in the time value for forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize them in interest and other income, net. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $787 million and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of forward and option contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts as well as the related costs in interest and other income, net, along with the gains and losses of the related hedged items. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase U.S. dollars with foreign currencies was $1.0 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell U.S. dollars for foreign currencies was $84 million and $472 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to purchase Euros with other foreign currencies was 991 million (or approximately $1.3 billion) and 711 million (or approximately $929 million) at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts to sell Euros for other foreign currencies was 6 million (or approximately $8 million) at December 31, 2010 and no such contracts were outstanding at December 31, 2011.\nWe also use exchange-traded interest rate futures contracts and “To Be Announced” (TBA) forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to hedge interest rate risks on certain fixed income securities. The TBA contracts meet the definition of derivative instruments in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. Our interest rate futures and TBA contracts (together interest rate contracts) are not designated as hedging instruments. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts as well as the related costs in interest and other income, net. The gains and losses are generally economically offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of AOCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from AOCI into interest and other income, net. As of December 31, 2011, the total notional amounts of interest rate contracts outstanding were $100 million.\nThe fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):\nThe effect of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships on income and other comprehensive income is summarized below (in millions):\nGains (losses) related to the ineffective portion of the hedges were not material in all periods presented.\nThe effect of derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationships on income is summarized below (in millions):\nLosses related to the amount excluded from effectiveness testing of the hedges were $0, $6 million, and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, December 31, 2010, and December 31, 2011.\nThe effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on income is summarized below (in millions):\nNote 6. Fair Value Measurements\nWe measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, auction rate securities (ARS), and foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts at fair value. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2-Include other inputs that are directly or indirectly observable in the marketplace.\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2. This is because we value our cash equivalents and marketable securities using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. We classify our investments in ARS within Level 3 because they are valued using valuation models with significant unobservable marketable inputs (see below). We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions):\n(1) This balance represents cash collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months.\nAt December 31, 2011, we held $118 million of ARS. Historically, these securities have provided liquidity through a Dutch auction process. However, these auctions began to fail in the first quarter of 2008. To estimate their fair values at December 31, 2011, we used a discounted cash flow model based on estimated interest rates, timing and amount of cash flows, the credit quality of the underlying securities, and illiquidity considerations.\nAt December 31, 2011, the estimated fair value of these ARS was $23 million below their costs. As we have no intent to sell these ARS and it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these ARS prior to recovery of our entire cost basis, we concluded the decline in the fair value was temporary and recorded the unrealized loss to AOCI on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2011. To the extent we determine that any impairment is other-than-temporary, we would record a charge to earnings. In addition, we have concluded that the auctions for these securities may continue to fail for at least the next 12 months and as a result, we classified them as non-current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2011.\nThe following table presents reconciliations for our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\nNote 7. Property and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following (in millions):\nNote 8. Acquisitions\nIn April 2011, we completed the acquisition of ITA Software, Inc. (ITA), a privately-held flight information software company, for $676 million in cash, of which $394 million was attributed to acquired intangible assets, $323 million to goodwill, and $41 million to net liabilities assumed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2011, we completed 78 other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for a total cash consideration of approximately $1.3 billion, of which $795 million was attributed to goodwill, $593 million to acquired intangible assets, and $86 million to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product offerings.\nPro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate.\nPatents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 6.3 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 6.6 years and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 4.2 years. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is $29 million.\nIn August 2011, we entered into a Merger Agreement with Motorola, a provider of innovative technologies, products and services that enable a range of mobile and wireline digital communication, information and entertainment experiences, under which we will acquire Motorola for $40 per share in cash, or a total of approximately $12.5 billion. The completion of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. In the event the Merger Agreement is terminated due to a failure to obtain certain regulatory approvals, we would be required to pay Motorola a fee of $2.5 billion. The transaction is currently expected to close in early 2012.\nNote 9. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2011 were as follows (in millions):\nInformation regarding our acquisition-related intangible assets is as follows (in millions):\nPatents and developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names and other have weighted-average useful lives from the date of purchase of 5.0 years, 6.1 years, and 4.3 years. Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011 was $266 million, $314 million, and $441 million. As of December 31, 2011, expected amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter was as follows (in millions):\nNote 10. Interest and Other Income, Net\nThe components of interest and other income, net were as follows (in millions):\nNote 11. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income are as follows (in millions):\nNote 12. Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring primarily between 2012 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table below. Certain of these arrangements have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis.\nAt December 31, 2011, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases, net of sublease income amounts, were as follows over each of the next five years and thereafter (in millions):\nCertain leases have adjustments for market provisions. Amounts in the above table represent our best estimates of future payments to be made under these leases. In addition, the above table does not include future rental income of $726 million related to the leases that we assumed in connection with our building purchases. Rent expense under operating leases, including co-location arrangements, was $323 million, $293 million, and $380 million in 2009, 2010, and 2011.\nPurchase Obligations\nWe had $1.9 billion of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, primarily related to payments related to certain of our distribution arrangements and video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, as well as data center operations and facility build-outs at December 31, 2011. In addition, we had $2.8 billion of open purchase orders for which we had not received the related services or goods at December 31, 2011. We have the right to cancel these open purchase orders prior to the date of delivery.\nLetters of Credit\nAt December 31, 2011, we had unused letters of credit for $46 million.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business to facilitate transactions of our services and products, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network Members, and lessors with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of December 31, 2011, we did not have any indemnification claims that we considered to be probable or reasonably possible.\nLegal Matters\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn June 23, 2011, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) Bureau of Competition and a subpoena from FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection relating to a review by the FTC of our business practices, including search and advertising. State attorneys general from the states of Texas, Ohio, and Mississippi have issued similar CIDs. We are cooperating with the FTC and the state attorneys general and responding to their information requests.\nThe European Commission’s (EC) Directorate General for Competition has also opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. On February 10, 2010, we received notification from the EC about three antitrust complaints filed by Ciao, Ejustice, and Foundem, respectively. On November 30, 2010, the EC formally opened proceedings against us. Since November 2010, 1plusV, parent company of Ejustice, and VfT, an association of business listings providers in Germany, have filed similar complaints against us. On March 31, 2011, Microsoft Corporation submitted a similar complaint to the EC against us. On the same day, the EC notified us of additional complaints filed by Elfvoetbal, Hotmaps, Interactive Labs, and nnpt.it, and on August 30, 2011 of a complaint by dealdujour.pro. On September 16, 2011, we responded to all of the allegations made against us. In addition, in December 2011, the Spanish Association of Daily Newspaper Publishers also submitted a complaint to the EC against us. We are cooperating with the EC and responding to its information requests.\nEPA Investigation\nIn February 2009, we learned of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation into an alleged release of refrigerant at one of our smaller data center facilities, which we acquired from DoubleClick, and the accuracy of related statements and records. We are cooperating with the EPA and have provided documents and other materials.\nDepartment of Justice Investigation (Advertising)\nIn connection with the resolution of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice into the use of Google advertising by certain advertisers, we accrued $500 million during the three months ended March 31, 2011, which was paid in August 2011 upon final resolution of that matter.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies, including Android, Google Search, Google AdWords, Google AdSense, Google Books, Google News, Google Image Search, Google Chrome, Google Talk, Google Voice, and YouTube, infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.\nIn addition, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Furthermore, such customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.\nOther\nWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust (such as the pending investigations by the FTC and the EC described above), intellectual\nproperty, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.\nCertain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.\nWith respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various other tax authorities. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of tax benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\nNote 13. Stockholders’ Equity\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nOur board of directors has authorized 100,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. At December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011, there were no shares issued or outstanding.\nClass A and Class B Common Stock\nOur board of directors has authorized two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. At December 31, 2011, there were 6,000,000,000 and 3,000,000,000 shares authorized and there were 257,552,401 and 67,342,362 shares outstanding of Class A and Class B common stock. The rights of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock. We refer to Class A and Class B common stock as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nStock Plans\nWe maintain the 1998 Stock Plan, the 2000 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan (No. 2), the 2003 Stock Plan (No. 3), the 2004 Stock Plan, and plans assumed through acquisitions, all of which are collectively referred to as the “Stock Plans.” Under our Stock Plans, incentive and nonqualified stock options or rights to purchase common stock may be granted to eligible participants. Options are generally granted for a term\nof 10 years. Options granted under the Stock Plans other than the 2004 Stock Plan may be exercised prior to vesting. Under the Stock Plans, we have also issued RSUs and restricted shares. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our stock at the time of vest. Except for options granted pursuant to our stock option exchange program completed in March 2009 (the Exchange), options granted and RSUs issued to employees under the Stock Plans generally vest over four years contingent upon employment with us on the vesting date.\nAt December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2011, there were 27,329,837 and 21,794,492 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plans.\nWe estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the BSM option pricing model. Our assumptions about stock-price volatility have been based exclusively on the implied volatilities of publicly traded options to buy our stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life of options granted to our employees. We estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock options granted (excluding options granted in connection with the Exchange discussed below) in the periods presented:\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our options for the year ended December 31, 2011:\n(1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the closing stock price of $645.90 of our Class A common stock on December 31, 2011.\n(2) Options expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nThe following table summarizes additional information regarding outstanding, exercisable, and exercisable and vested stock options at December 31, 2011:\nThe above tables include approximately 1.2 million warrants held by selected financial institutions that were options purchased from employees under our TSO program, with a weighted-average exercise price of $336.64 and a weighted-average remaining life of 1.1 years.\nDuring 2011, the number of shares underlying TSOs sold to selected financial institutions under the TSO program was 635,047 at a total value of $167 million, or an average of $262.74 per share, including an average premium of $11.09 per share. The premium is calculated as the difference between (a) the sale price of the TSO and (b) the intrinsic value of the TSO, which we define as the excess, if any, of the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the sale over the exercise price of the TSO.\nThe total grant date fair value of stock options vested during 2009, 2010, and 2011 was $690 million, $690 million, and $561 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of all options and warrants exercised during 2009, 2010, and 2011 was $566 million, $794 million, and $674 million. These amounts do not include the aggregate sales price of options sold under our TSO program.\nAs of December 31, 2011, there was $583 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding employee stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2011:\n(1) RSUs expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nAs of December 31, 2011, there was $3,727 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nNote 14. 401(k) Plan\nWe have a 401(k) Savings Plan (401(k) Plan) that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 60% of their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Employee and our contributions are fully vested when contributed. We contributed approximately $83 million, $100 million, and $136 million during 2009, 2010, and 2011.\nNote 15. Income Taxes\nIncome before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $3,579 million, $4,948 million, and $4,693 million for 2009, 2010, and 2011, and income from foreign operations of $4,802 million, $5,848 million, and $7,633 million for 2009, 2010, and 2011. Substantially all of the income from foreign operations was earned by an Irish subsidiary.\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions):\nThe reconciliation of federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):\nWe have not provided U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2011 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of December 31, 2011, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $24.8 billion. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.\nDeferred Tax Assets\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2011, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $420 million and $310 million. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2014. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.\nAs of December 31, 2011, our California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $55 million that can be carried over indefinitely. We believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the state tax credit will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance on the state tax credit carryforward in the amount of $48 million. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nAs of December 31, 2011, our federal and state capital loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $165 million and $422 million. We also have deferred tax assets for impairment losses that, if recognized, will be capital in nature. We believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets for capital losses and impairment losses will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance on both our federal and state deferred tax assets for these items in the amount of $285 million. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits from January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2011 (in millions):\nOur total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $814 million, $951 million, and $1,350 million as of December 31, 2009, 2010, and 2011.\nAs of December 31, 2010 and 2011, we had accrued $97 million and $129 million for payment of interest and penalties. Interest and penalties included in our provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.\nWe and our subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. Although we file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns, our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and Ireland. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, the IRS completed its examination of our 2003 and 2004 tax years. We have filed an\nappeal with the IRS for certain issues related to this audit and no resolution of the issues has been achieved at this time, but we believe we have adequately provided for these items and any adverse results would have an immaterial impact on our unrecognized tax benefit balance within the next 12 months. The IRS is currently in examination of our 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years. We do not expect the examination to be completed within the next 12 months. Therefore, we do not anticipate any significant impact to our unrecognized tax benefit balance in 2012, related to our 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years.\nOur 2010 and 2011 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes, and our 2003 through 2011 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are various other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\nNote 16. Information about Geographic Areas\nOur chief operating decision-makers (i.e., chief executive officer and his direct reports) review financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. There are no segment managers who are held accountable by our chief operating decision-makers, or anyone else, for operations, operating results, and planning for levels or components below the consolidated unit level. Accordingly, we consider ourselves to be in a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.\nRevenues by geography are based on the billing addresses of our customers. The following tables set forth revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area (in millions):",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2011, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2011 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2011. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.",

         "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nGoogle is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. We aspire to build products and provide services that improve the lives of billions of people globally. Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our innovations in web search and advertising have made our website a top internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in the world.\nOur Motorola business is comprised of two operating segments. The Mobile segment is focused on mobile wireless devices and related products and services. The Home segment is focused on technologies and devices that provide video entertainment services to consumers by enabling subscribers to access a variety of interactive digital television services.\nWe generate revenue primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising. Businesses use our AdWords program to promote their products and services with targeted advertising. In addition, the third parties that comprise the Google Network use our AdSense program to deliver relevant ads that generate revenues and enhance the user experience. We also generate revenues from Motorola by selling hardware products.\nIn December 2012, we entered into an agreement with Arris Group, Inc. (Arris) and certain other persons providing for the disposition of our Motorola Home segment. The transaction is expected to close in 2013.\nOur business is primarily focused around the following key areas: search, advertising, operating systems and platforms, enterprise and hardware products.\nWe were incorporated in California in September 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware in August 2003. Our headquarters are located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, and our telephone number is (650) 253-0000. We completed our initial public offering in August 2004 and our Class A common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG.”\n2012 Corporate Highlights\n•\nAndroid-The growth of our Android operating system continues to impress with approximately half a billion Android devices activated globally through September 2012.\n•\nGoogle Play-We launched Google Play, an entirely cloud-based, digital entertainment destination with more than 700,000 apps and games plus music, movies and books that our users can find, enjoy and share on the web and on their Android phone or tablet.\n•\nSocial-“Growing the + and shipping the Google.” In 2011, we launched Google+, a new way to share online just like users do in the real world, sharing different things with different people. In late 2011 and continuing in 2012, we have tightened integration between Google+ and our other Google properties, such as Gmail and YouTube and now have 235 million active users across our Google properties.\n•\nNexus 7 Tablet-We launched a powerful new tablet in June 2012 with a vibrant, 7” high-definition display. The Tegra-3 chipset, with a quad-core CPU and 12-core GPU, makes everything, including games, extremely fast. And at only 340 grams, lighter than most tablets, Nexus 7 was built to bring users the best of Google that can be held in the palm of the user’s hand.\n•\nGoogle Now-We introduced Google Now, a predictive search feature that gets you just the right information at just the right time. It tells you the day’s weather before you start your day, how much traffic to expect before you leave for work or school, when the next train will arrive as you’re standing on the platform, or your favorite team’s score while they’re playing - all automatically with cards appearing throughout the day at the moment you need them.\n•\nKnowledge Graph-Google’s Knowledge Graph, introduced in 2012, enables the user to search for things, people or places that Google knows about - landmarks, celebrities, cities, sports teams, buildings, geographical features, movies, works of arts and more - and enhances Google Search by understanding the ambiguities in language and by better understanding a user’s query.\nOn December 19, 2012, Google and Arris announced that Motorola Mobility had entered into an agreement (Motorola Agreement) with Arris and certain other persons providing for the disposition of the Home business for total consideration of approximately $2.35 billion in cash and common stock, subject to certain adjustments. Arris announced in January 2013 that it has agreed to sell approximately 10.6 million shares of its common stock, valued at $150.0 million, to Comcast Corporation with the closing of the Comcast investment and the Home business disposition expected to occur simultaneously. As provided for in the Motorola Agreement, the Comcast transaction will reduce the amount of stock consideration and increase the amount of cash consideration to be received by Google, but will not affect the total consideration. Specifically, the shares issued to Comcast will reduce, on a share-for-share basis, the number of shares of Arris common stock to be issued to Google and simultaneously increase the cash consideration to be received by Google by $150.0 million. Assuming the completion of the Comcast transaction, Comcast and Google will each own approximately 7.85% of the outstanding Arris common stock post-closing based on Arris’ capitalization as of the date of Arris’ announcement of the Comcast transaction. The disposition of the Home business to Arris is not contingent upon Arris’ sale of common stock to Comcast. In the event that Arris’ sale of common stock to Comcast does not close for any reason, there will be no reduction in the amount of shares of Arris common stock to be issued to Google and no corresponding increase in the amount of cash consideration. In that case, Google will own approximately 15.7% of the outstanding Arris common stock post-closing based on Arris’ capitalization as of the date of the Arris’ announced transaction with Google. The disposition of the Home business is expected to close in 2013.\nIn January 2013, the FTC closed its investigations into our business practices, including search and advertising. In connection with the closing of the investigation, we have voluntarily agreed to make certain product changes. In addition, we and Motorola have entered into a consent order with the FTC setting forth certain guidelines on our use of standards-essential patents in litigation.\nSearch\nOur search technologies sort through an ever-growing amount of information to deliver relevant and useful search results in response to user queries. We integrate innovative features into our search service and offer specialized search services to help users tailor their search. In addition, we are constantly improving and adding to our products and services, to provide users with more relevant results so that users find what they are looking for faster. For instance, when users want to plan a trip, Flight Search is a feature that makes it easy for users to find flights that meet their needs. Whether they have a specific destination with dates in mind or not, Flight Search can help users quickly find the best options for their trips. We also offer Product Listing Ads, which include richer product information, such as product image, price, and merchant information, without requiring additional keywords or ad text.\nIn January 2012, we launched Search plus Your World. Now, when a user performs a signed-in search on Google, the user’s results page may include Google+ content from people that the user is close to (or might be interested in following). Relevant Google+ profiles and Google+ pages related to a specific topic or area of interest may also appear on a user’s results page.\nIn 2012, we also introduced Google Now and Google’s Knowledge Graph. Google Now is a predictive search feature that gets you just the right information at just the right time. It tells you the day’s weather before you start your day, how much traffic to expect before you leave for work or school, when the next train will arrive as you’re standing on the platform, or your favorite team’s score while they’re playing-all automatically with cards appearing throughout the day at the moment you need them. Google’s Knowledge Graph, introduced in 2012,\nenables the user to search for things, people or places that Google knows about - landmarks, celebrities, cities, sports teams, buildings, geographical features, movies, works of arts and more - and enhances Google Search in three main ways:\n•\nFind the Right Thing-By understanding the ambiguities and nuances in language the way users do, the Knowledge Graph makes Google Search more intelligent and relevant.\n•\nGet the Best Summary-With the Knowledge Graph, we can better understand a user’s query, so that we can summarize relevant content around that topic, including key facts users likely need for that particular query.\n•\nGo Deeper and Broader-The Knowledge Graph can help you make some unexpected discoveries. We’ve always believed that the perfect search engine should understand exactly what you mean and give you back exactly what you want. And we can sometimes help answer your next question before you’ve asked it, because the facts we show are informed by what other people have searched for.\nAdvertising\nGoogle Search. The goal of AdWords, our primary auction-based advertising program, is to deliver ads that are so useful and relevant to search queries or web content that they are a form of information in their own right. With AdWords, advertisers create simple text-based ads that then appear beside related search results or web content on our websites and on thousands of partner websites in our Google Network, which is the network of third parties that use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads with their search results and content. Most of our AdWords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites as specified by the advertiser.\nOur AdSense program enables websites that are part of the Google Network to deliver ads from our AdWords advertisers that are relevant to the search results or content on their websites. We share the majority of the revenues generated from these ads with the Google Network Members that display the ads. The AdSense program enables advertisers to extend the reach of their ad campaigns, improves our partners’ ability to generate revenue from their content, and delivers relevant ads for their users.\nTo make mobile ad buying seamless and accessible for more than a million AdWords advertisers, we integrated our AdMob technology directly into our AdWords system in June 2012. This enables advertisers to run effective campaigns across the more than 300,000 mobile applications running ads by AdMob - all from within the AdWords interface. AdWords advertisers can now manage, measure and adjust search, display and video ads, reaching people on more than 2 million websites and hundreds of thousands of apps, across all screens.\nGoogle Display. Display advertising comprises the videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets. The Google Display Network provides advertisers services related to the delivery of display advertising across publishers participating in our AdSense program, publishers participating in the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, and Google-owned sites such as YouTube and Google Finance.\nThrough our DoubleClick advertising technology, we provide to publishers, agencies, and advertisers the ad serving technology, which is the infrastructure that enables billions of ads to be served each day across the web. Our DoubleClick Ad Exchange creates a real-time auction marketplace for the trading of display ad space. We aim to simplify display advertising so it is easier for advertisers and publishers to manage campaigns across different formats, on different websites, and for different devices.\nIn addition, YouTube provides a range of video, interactive, and other ad formats for advertisers to reach their intended audience. YouTube’s video advertising solutions give advertisers a way to promote their content to the\nYouTube community, as well as to associate with content being watched by their target audience. YouTube also offers analytic tools to help advertisers understand their audience and derive general business intelligence. In the past year, YouTube has experienced strong growth in mobile viewers and has established key partnerships with content companies to help monetize mobile video.\nGoogle Mobile. Mobile advertising is still in early innings, though the mobile device is quickly becoming the world’s newest gateway to information. Google is focused on developing easy-to-use ad products to help advertisers extend their reach, help create revenue opportunities for our publisher partners, and deliver relevant and useful ads to users on the go.\nGoogle Mobile extends our products and services by providing mobile-specific features to mobile device users. Our mobile-specific search technologies include search by voice, search by sight, and search by location. Google Mobile also optimizes a large number of Google’s applications for mobile devices in both browser and downloadable form. In addition, we offer advertisers the ability to run search ad campaigns on mobile devices with popular mobile-specific ad formats, such as click-to-call ads in which advertisers can include a phone number within ad text. AdMob also offers effective ad units and solutions for application developers and advertisers. We continue to invest in improving users’ access to Google services through their mobile devices.\nGoogle Local. Google is committed to providing users with relevant local information. We’ve organized information around more than 80 million places globally from various sources across the web. Users can find addresses, phone numbers, hours of operation, directions and more for millions of local queries like shops, restaurants, parks and landmarks right on Google.com, on Google Maps and on Google Maps for mobile. They can also discover more places that are right for them by rating the places they’ve been, and getting customized recommendations based on their tastes and those of their friends directly within Google Maps. Our products and services also help local business owners manage their online presence and connect with potential customers. Millions of business owners have verified their free business listings via Google Places to ensure that users have up-to-date information about their establishments, and to contribute additional details such as photos and products/services offered. Google Offers brings people daily deals from local and national businesses, redeemable for discounted goods or services. From restaurants to spa treatments to outdoor adventures, Google has deals from the best businesses a city has to offer as well as popular national brands.\nOperating Systems and Platforms\nAndroid. Working closely with the Open Handset Alliance, a business alliance of more than 75 technology and mobile companies, we developed Android, a free, fully open source mobile software platform that any developer can use to create applications for mobile devices and any handset manufacturer can install on a device. We believe Android will drive greater innovation and choice in the mobile device ecosystem, and provide consumers with a more powerful mobile experience.\nGoogle Chrome OS and Google Chrome. Google Chrome OS is an open source operating system with the Google Chrome web browser as its foundation. Both the Google Chrome OS and the Google Chrome browser are built around the core tenets of speed, simplicity, and security. Designed for people who spend most of their time on the web, the Google Chrome OS is a new approach to operating systems. We are working with several original equipment manufacturers to bring computers running Google Chrome OS to users and businesses. The Chrome browser runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux computers.\nGoogle+. Google+ is a new way to share online just like users do in the real world, sharing different things with different people. In late 2011 and continuing in 2012, we have tightened integration between Google+ and our other Google properties, such as Gmail and YouTube and now have 235 million active users across our Google properties.\nGoogle Play. Google Play is an entirely cloud-based, digital entertainment destination with more than 700,000 apps and games plus music, movies and books that our users can find, enjoy and share on the web and on their Android phone or tablet.\nGoogle Drive. Google Drive is a place where users can create, share, collaborate, and keep all of their stuff. Google Docs is built right into Google Drive so users can work with others in real time on documents, spreadsheets and presentations and users’ files go everywhere they do. When users change a file on the web, on their computer, or on their mobile device, the file updates on every device where users have installed Google Drive.\nGoogle Wallet. Google Wallet is a virtual wallet that securely stores your credit and debit cards, offers, and rewards cards. Users can tap their phone to pay in-store using Google Wallet anywhere contactless payments are accepted - at over 200,000 merchants across the United States. Users can also pay online by signing into their Google Wallet account.\nGoogle TV. Google TV is a platform that gives consumers the power to experience television and the internet on a single screen, with the ability to search and find the content they want to watch. The Google TV platform is based on the Android operating system and runs the Google Chrome browser.\nEnterprise\nGoogle’s enterprise products provide familiar, easy-to-use Google technology for business settings. Through Google Apps, which includes Gmail, Google Docs, Google Calendar, and Google Sites, among other features, we provide hosted, web-based applications that people can use on any device with a browser and an internet connection. In addition, we provide our search technology for use within enterprises through the Google Search Appliance (real-time search of business applications, intranet applications, and public websites), on their public-facing sites with Google Site Search (custom search engine), and Google Commerce Search (for online retail enterprises). We also provide versions of our Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API) for businesses (including fully interactive Google Maps for public and internal websites), as well as Google Earth Enterprise (a behind-the-company-firewall software solution for imagery and data visualization). Our enterprise solutions have been adopted by a variety of businesses, governments, schools, and non-profit organizations. Google Apps is the first cloud computing suite of message and collaboration tools to receive U.S. government security certification.\nMotorola\nOur Motorola Mobility business is comprised of two operating segments. The Mobile segment is focused on mobile wireless devices and related products and services. The Home segment is focused on technologies and devices that provide video entertainment services to consumers by enabling subscribers to access a variety of interactive digital television services. In December 2012, we entered into an agreement with Arris Group, Inc. and certain other persons providing for the disposition of our Home segment. The transaction is expected to close in 2013.\nResearch\nWe continue to develop new products and services and to enhance our existing ones through research and product development and the licensing and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Our product development philosophy is to launch innovative products early and often, and then iterate rapidly to make those products even better. We often post early stage products at test locations online or directly on Google.com. We then use data and user feedback to decide if and how to invest further in those products.\nOur research and development expenses were $3.8 billion, $5.2 billion, and $6.8 billion in 2010, 2011, and 2012, respectively, which included stock-based compensation expense of $861 million, $1.1 billion, and $1.3 billion, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in building the employee and systems infrastructures needed to support the development of new products and services and to improve existing ones.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. Over time, we have assembled a portfolio of patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, and trade secrets covering our products and services. Our proprietary technology is not dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. Although we rigorously protect our proprietary technology, any significant impairment of, or third-party claim against, our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.\nSales and Support\nWe continue to develop and grow our sales and support infrastructure. We have over 85 offices in over 40 countries, the large majority of which include sales people. Our global sales and support infrastructure has specialized teams across vertical markets. We bring businesses into our advertising network through direct, remote, and online sales channels, using technology and automation wherever possible to improve our customers’ experience and to grow our business cost-effectively. Our direct advertising and sales teams focus on building relationships with the largest advertisers and leading internet companies. We have built a multi-product sales force, with teams selling campaigns that include search, display (including DoubleClick and YouTube), and mobile advertising.\nWe provide customer service to our advertiser base through our global support organization. Our global support organization concentrates on helping our advertisers and Google Network Members get the most out of their relationship with us.\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2010, 2011, or 2012.\nGovernment Contracts\nNo material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.\nMarketing\nGoogle’s global brand is well known. We believe that building a trusted, highly recognized brand begins with providing high-quality products and services that make a notable difference in people’s lives. Marketing is responsible for generating advertiser revenue through marketing campaigns to small businesses, as well as providing thought leadership to chief marketing officers through industry insight, research, and analysis. Our marketing, promotional, and public relations activities are designed to promote Google’s brand image and differentiate it from competitors.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change and converging, as well as new and disruptive, technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with information on the web and provide them with relevant advertising. We face competition from:\n•\nGeneral purpose search engines, such as Yahoo and Microsoft’s Bing.\n•\nVertical search engines and e-commerce websites, such as Kayak (travel queries), Monster.com (job queries), WebMD (for health queries), and Amazon.com and eBay (e-commerce). Some users will navigate directly to such websites rather than go through Google.\n•\nSocial networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. Some users are relying more on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through general purpose search engines.\n•\nOther forms of advertising, such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, and yellow pages, for ad dollars. Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n•\nMobile applications on iPhone and Android devices, which allow users to access information directly from a publisher without using search engines.\n•\nProviders of online products and services. A number of our online products and services, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs, compete directly with new and established companies, which offer communication, information, and entertainment services integrated into their products or media properties.\nWe compete to attract and retain users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, primarily on the basis of the relevance and usefulness of our search results and the features, availability, and ease of use of our products and services.\nWe also compete to attract and retain content providers (Google Network Members, as well as other content providers for whom we distribute or license content), primarily based on the size and quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matter. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nCulture and Employees\nWe take great pride in our culture. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex technical challenges. Transparency and open dialog are central to us, and we like to ensure that company news reaches our employees first through internal channels.\nDespite our rapid growth, we still cherish our roots as a startup and give employees the freedom to act on their ideas regardless of role or function within the company. We strive to hire the best employees, with backgrounds and perspectives as diverse as our global users. We provide an environment where these talented people can have fulfilling careers working on some of the biggest challenges in technology, and have a huge, positive impact on the world.\nAt December 31, 2012, we had 53,861 full-time employees, consisting of 19,746 in research and development, 15,306 in sales and marketing, 6,214 in general and administrative, and 12,595 in operations. All of Google’s full-time employees are also equityholders, with significant collective employee ownership. Although we have works councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff.\nGlobal Operations and Geographic Data\nWe provide our products and services in more than 100 languages and in more than 50 countries, regions, and territories. On www.google.com or one of our other Google domains, users can find information in many\ndifferent languages and in many different formats. The United States accounted for approximately 47% of our revenues in 2012. Information regarding financial data by geographic areas is set forth in Item 7 and Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.google.com, and our investor relations website is located at http://investor.google.com. The following filings are available through our investor relations website after we file them with the SEC: Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our Proxy Statements for our annual meetings of stockholders, for the last three years. These filings are also available for download free of charge on our investor relations website. We also provide a link to the section of the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov that has all of our public filings, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, all amendments to those reports, our Proxy Statements, and other ownership related filings. Further, a copy of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is located at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room can be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.\nWe webcast our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host with members of the investment community on our investor relations website. Additionally, we provide notifications of news or announcements regarding our financial performance, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs as part of our investor relations website as well as on our investor relations Google+ page (https://plus.google.com/+GoogleInvestorRelations/posts). Investors and others can receive notifications of new information posted on our investor relations website in real time by signing up for email alerts and RSS feeds. Further corporate governance information, including our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines, board committee charters, and code of conduct, is also available on our investor relations website under the heading “Corporate Governance.” The contents of our websites are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.",
         "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and is subject to changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to compete successfully depends heavily on providing products and services that make using the internet a more useful and enjoyable experience for our users and delivering innovative products and technologies to the marketplace. With our acquisition of Motorola, the competitive pressure to innovate will now encompass a wider range of products and services, including products and services that may be outside of our historical core business.\nWe have many competitors in different industries, including general purpose search engines, vertical search engines and e-commerce sites, social networking sites, traditional media companies, wireless mobile device companies, and providers of online products and services. Our current and potential competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Established companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users, and they can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, investing aggressively in research and development, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious) and competing aggressively for advertisers and websites. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can.\nOur competitors are constantly developing innovations in web search, online advertising, wireless mobile devices, and web-based products and services. The research and development of new, technologically advanced products is also a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment, as well as the accurate anticipation of technology, market trends and consumer needs. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our web search technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. If we are unable to provide quality products and services, then acceptance rates for our products and services could decline and affect consumer and advertiser perceptions of our brand. In addition, these new products and services may present new and difficult technological and legal challenges, and we may be subject to claims if users of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other issues. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, and Google Network Members, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities, or are not effectively brought to market. As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer user experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, and content providers, our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur ongoing investment in new business strategies and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our ongoing businesses.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new business strategies, products, services, and technologies. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nAcquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and we expect our current pace of acquisitions to continue. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:\n•\nDiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges.\n•\nFailure to successfully further develop the acquired business or technology.\n•\nImplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.\n•\nIntegration of the acquired company’s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions.\n•\nTransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.\n•\nFailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval, under competition and antitrust laws which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition.\n•\nIn the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\n•\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire.\n•\nLiability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.\n•\nLitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\nFuture acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or results. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and a reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could seriously harm our business.\nWe generated 95% of Google revenues from our advertisers in 2012. Following our acquisition of Motorola, we still expect a significant portion of our revenues to come from advertising. Our advertisers can generally terminate their contracts with us at any time. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in advertising with us does not generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, or if we do not deliver their advertisements in an appropriate and effective manner. If we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertisers, they may stop placing ads with us, which would adversely affect our revenues and business.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, which could adversely affect our revenues and business.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, changes in our product mix, including a significant increase in mobile search queries and a deceleration in the growth of desktop queries if monetization stays at current levels, and how users make queries\nand act on them, the challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, the evolution of the online advertising market, including the increasing variety of online platforms for advertising, and the other markets in which we participate and the success of our investments in new business strategies, products, services, and technologies, such as our acquisition of Motorola.\nThe revenue growth rate of our Motorola business will also depend on a number of factors, including the success of the new products we plan to introduce, our reliance on several large customers, the absence of long-term exclusivity arrangements with such customers, our ability to gain significant market share in the mobile devices space, our reliance on third-party distributors, representatives and retailers to sell certain of its products and the successful implementation of our product and operating system strategies. Furthermore, industry consolidation in the telecommunications and cable industries could negatively impact Motorola’s business because there would be fewer network operators and it could be more difficult to replace any lost customers. Any of these factors could have a negative impact on Motorola’s business and have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.\nWe believe our operating margin will experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for many aspects of our business, including Motorola. For instance, our operating margin will experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our Google Network Members’ websites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on our own websites or if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote the distribution of certain products, including Google Chrome. Both the margin on revenues we generate from our Google Network Members and the margin on revenues from our Motorola business are significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites. Also, the margins on advertising revenues from mobile devices and newer advertising formats are generally less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites. Additionally, the margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network Members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google Network Members.\nWe are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business.\nThe growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields implicate a variety of new regulatory issues, and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown. We continue to cooperate with the European Commission (EC), other international regulatory authorities, and several state attorneys general in investigations they are conducting with respect to our business and its impact on competition. Legislators and regulators, including those conducting investigations in the U.S. and Europe, may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material ways.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust (such as the pending investigations by the EC), intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Our acquisition of Motorola and our sale of hardware products also expose us to the risk of product liability and other litigation involving assertions about product defects, as well as health and safety, hazardous materials usage, and other environmental concerns. In addition, our businesses face intellectual property litigation, as further discussed later, that exposes us to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell products and services.\nSuch claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have an adverse\nimpact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in our business practices or product recalls or other field action, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nMore people are using devices other than personal computers to access the internet and accessing new platforms to make search queries. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our web search technology, products, or operating systems developed for these devices, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets, video game consoles, and television set-top devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years. The lower resolution, functionality, and memory associated with some alternative devices make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users, manufacturers, or distributors of alternative devices. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via “apps” tailored to particular devices or social media platforms, which could affect our share of the search market over time. As new devices and platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of mobile products and services. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, distributors, and users to our products and services, or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms, we will fail to capture the opportunities available as consumers and advertisers transition to a dynamic, multi-screen environment.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners.\nThe brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the “Google” brand is critical to expanding our base of users, advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the internet market. Our brand may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including data protection and security issues, service outages, and product malfunctions. If we fail to maintain and enhance the “Google” brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products and services, which we may not do successfully.\nA variety of new and existing U.S. and foreign laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nFurthermore, many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies. The laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. For example, the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the U.S. and abroad. Claims have also been, or may be, threatened and filed against us under both U.S. and foreign laws for defamation, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users, our products and services, or content generated by our users. Moreover, recent amendments to U.S. patent laws may affect the ability of companies, including us, to protect their innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement.\nIn addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for caching or hosting, or for listing or linking to, third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Any future legislation impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact us. Various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California’s Information Practices Act. We face similar risks and costs as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property or other claims, which are costly to defend, could result in significant damage awards, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nInternet, technology, and media companies own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As we have grown, the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies.\nWe have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies, including Android, Google Search, Google AdWords, Google AdSense, Motorola products, Google Books, Google News, Google Image Search, Google Chrome, Google Talk, Google Voice, and YouTube, infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.\nIn addition, many of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business. Moreover, supplier provided intellectual property indemnities to us, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers from covered products. In addition, in connection with the sale of Motorola’s Home business to Arris Group, Inc. (Arris), we agreed to\nindemnify Arris against certain intellectual property infringement litigation, including, among others, a patent infringement claim brought by TiVo relating to certain digital video recording equipment sold by Motorola Mobility.\nRegardless of the merits of the claims, intellectual property claims are often time consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and cause significant diversion of management attention. To the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful, they may have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective.\nAlthough we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, because of our long-term interests in open source, we may not have adequate patent protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.\nWe also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.\nWe may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.\nWe host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat unsettled both within the U.S. and internationally. Claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright or trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information which we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties, including our users. In addition, we are and have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we have generated or third-party content that we have made available within our services violates laws in domestic and international jurisdictions.\nWe also arrange for the distribution of third-party advertisements to third-party publishers and advertising networks, and we offer third-party products, services, or content. We may be subject to claims concerning these\nproducts, services, or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting, or providing access to them, even if we do not ourselves host, operate, provide, or provide access to these products, services, or content. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources, may result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services.\nFrom time to time, concerns have been expressed by regulators and others about whether our products, services, or processes compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about, or regulatory actions involving our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect operating results. While we strive to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, as well as our own posted privacy policies, the failure or perceived failure to comply may result, and in some cases has resulted, in inquiries and other proceedings or actions against us by government entities or others, or could cause us to lose users and customers, which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, as nearly all of our products and services are web-based, the amount of data we store for our users on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users’ data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We expect to continue to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based products and services we offer, and operate in more countries.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nWith our acquisition of Motorola, we face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results and prospects.\nWith our acquisition of Motorola, we face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management. For instance, the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from the software used in the product. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our Motorola products does not meet our customers’ expectations or our products are found to be defective, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture many of Motorola’s assemblies and finished products, and we have third-party arrangements for the design of some components and parts. Our Motorola business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other materials terms of our arrangements with them.\nMotorola, like many electronics manufacturers, has also experienced supply shortages and price increases in the past driven by raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural\ndisasters and significant changes in the financial or business condition of its suppliers. Workaround plans to address shortages have entailed in the past, and could entail in the future, increased freight costs for expedited shipments. We cannot assure you that we will not experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future or that they will not negatively impact our operations. In addition, some of the components we use in our Motorola products are available only from a single source or limited sources, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain disruption.\nAdditionally, because many of our supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our Motorola sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our Motorola products more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results. Further, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supply.\nWe also require our suppliers and business partners to comply with law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. If any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical, we could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations of or damage to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. If any of them fails to procure necessary license rights to third-party intellectual property, legal action could ensue that could impact the salability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third parties.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act included disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries (DRC) and procedures regarding a manufacturer’s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict” minerals. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply DRC “conflict free” components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain DRC conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the conflict minerals used in our products.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of users’ and customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis, and as a result, unauthorized parties have obtained, and may in the future obtain, access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers.\nWeb spam and content farms could decrease our search quality, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\n“Web spam” refers to websites that attempt to violate a search engine’s quality guidelines or that otherwise seek to rank higher in search results than a search engine’s assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been significantly reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek ways to improve their rankings inappropriately. We continuously combat web spam, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We face challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including “content farms,” which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes focused on low-quality websites. If web spam and content farms continue to increase on Google, this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce user traffic to our websites. In addition, as we continue to take actions to improve our search quality and reduce low-quality content, this may in the short run reduce our AdSense revenues, since some of these websites are AdSense partners.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services, or damage to or failure of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services, which could reduce our revenues and profits, and damage our brand.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to further expand internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated revenues in 2012, and more than half of our user traffic has been coming from outside the U.S. In certain international markets, we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed.\nOur Motorola business also has facilities outside the U.S., and nearly all of our Motorola products (other than some prototypes) are manufactured outside the U.S., primarily in China, Taiwan and Brazil. If our manufacturing in these countries is disrupted, our overall capacity could be reduced and sales or profitability could be negatively impacted. We require these suppliers and business partners to comply with law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. If any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical, we could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations of or damage to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. If any of them fails to procure necessary license rights to third-party intellectual property, legal action could ensue that could impact the salability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third parties.\nMoreover, in connection with our operations in Brazil, we have had and continue to have legal disputes and controversies, including tax, labor and trade compliance controversies and other legal matters that take many\nyears to resolve. We incur legal and other costs in managing and defending these matters and expect to continue to incur such costs. Based on our assessment of these matters, we have recorded reserves on only a small portion of the total potential exposure. It is, however, very difficult to predict the outcome of legal disputes and controversies, including litigation, in Brazil and our ultimate exposure may be greater than our current assessments and related reserves.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:\n•\nChanges in local political, economic, social, and labor conditions, which may adversely harm our business.\n•\nRestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.\n•\nImport and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, and customs classifications that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market and may increase our operating costs.\n•\nPotential injunctions from importation into the U.S. of our Motorola products manufactured outside the U.S. in an ITC matter.\n•\nLonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.\n•\nStill developing foreign laws and legal systems.\n•\nUncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent.\n•\nDifferent employee/employer relationships, existence of workers’ councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\n•\nNatural disasters, military or political conflicts, including war and other hostilities, and public health issues and outbreaks.\nIn addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and antitrust and competition regulations, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nFinally, since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net income. Additionally, hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely\non our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date, and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this section in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results:\n•\nOur ability to continue to attract users to our websites and satisfy existing users on our websites.\n•\nOur ability to monetize (or generate revenues from) traffic on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites.\n•\nOur ability to attract advertisers to our AdWords program, and our ability to attract websites to our AdSense program.\n•\nThe mix in our revenues between those generated on our websites and those generated through our Google Network and other factors, such as changes in product mix, including a significant increase in mobile search queries and a deceleration in the growth of desktop queries if monetization stays at current levels, and the geographic mix of our revenues that can affect revenue growth rates and margins.\n•\nThe amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and our ability to manage the resulting risk through our foreign exchange risk management program.\n•\nThe amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure.\n•\nOur focus on long-term goals over short-term results.\n•\nThe results of our investments in risky projects, including new business strategies and new products, services, technologies and acquisitions.\n•\nOur ability to keep our websites operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions.\n•\nOur ability to generate significant revenues from services in which we have invested considerable time and resources, such as Google Wallet.\nBecause our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results. In addition, advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. Also, user traffic tends to be seasonal. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.\nIf we were to lose the services of Larry, Sergey, Eric, or other key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In particular, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are critical to the overall management of Google and the development of our technology. Along with our Executive Chairman Eric E. Schmidt, they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award\nprograms, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take, measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. Such interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth.\nNew technologies could block our ads, which would harm our business.\nTechnologies have been developed (including by us) that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of our advertising products. Most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages for our users. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.\nGiven the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally. Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Stock\nThe trading price for our Class A common stock may continue to be volatile, and if the shares of the new class of non-voting Class C capital stock are distributed as expected, the trading price of that class may also be volatile and may affect the trading price for the Class A common stock.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example, from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the closing price of our Class A common stock ranged from $559.05 per share to $768.05 per share. The trading price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n•\nQuarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors.\n•\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments.\n•\nRecommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.\n•\nAnnouncements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance on earnings.\n•\nAnnouncements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.\n•\nCommentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other matters affecting our business and results, regardless of its accuracy.\n•\nThe volume of shares of Class A common stock available for public sale.\n•\nSales of Class A common stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by our directors, executive officers, and other employees).\n•\nShort sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Class A common stock (including derivative transactions under our Transferable Stock Option program).\nIn addition, we have announced the intention of our board of directors to consider a distribution of shares of our non-voting Class C capital stock as a dividend to our holders of Class A and Class B common stock, pending resolution of litigation involving the authorization of that class.\nAlthough we plan to list the Class C capital stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, a liquid trading market will develop for the Class C capital stock. If it does not or if the Class C capital stock is not attractive to targets as an acquisition currency or to our employees as an incentive, we may not achieve our objectives in creating this new class. As in the case of the Class A common stock, the trading price for the Class C capital stock may also be volatile and affected by the factors noted above, as well as by the difference in voting rights as between the Class A common stock and the Class C capital stock, the volume of Class C capital stock available for public sale and sales by us and our stockholders of Class C capital stock, including by institutional investors that may be unwilling, unable or choose not to hold non-voting shares they receive as part of the stock dividend, if it is declared and paid. Whether or not the Class C capital stock is included in stock indices in the future may also affect the trading prices of the Class A common stock and the Class C capital stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock, and, if issued, our Class C capital Stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2012, Larry, Sergey, and Eric beneficially owned approximately 92% of our outstanding Class B\ncommon stock, representing approximately 65% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Larry, Sergey, and Eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C capital stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C capital stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could prolong the duration of Larry and Sergey’s current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Together with Eric, they would also continue to be able to control any required stockholder vote with respect to certain change in control transactions involving Google (including an acquisition of Google by another company).\nThis concentrated control limits or severely restricts our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock and, if issued, our Class C capital stock could be adversely affected.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class common stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry, Sergey, and Eric have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. As noted above, the issuance of the Class C capital stock could have the effect of prolonging the influence of Larry, Sergey, and Eric.\n•\nOur board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.\n•\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders’ meeting.\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n•\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n•\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.",

Motorola owns eight facilities (manufacturing, sales, service and offices), five of which are located in the Americas Region (U.S., Canada, Mexico, Central America and South America) and three of which are located in other countries. As of December 31, 2012, Motorola leased 97 facilities, 31 of which are located in the Americas Region and 66 of which are located in other countries. Motorola Mobility owns three major facilities for the manufacturing and distribution of its products. These facilities are located in Tianjin, China; Hsin Tien, Taiwan; and Jaguariuna, Brazil. As previously reported, Motorola is executing a significant consolidation of its portfolio, which will reduce the number of facilities worldwide, including manufacturing, sales and marketing, and research and development locations.\nWe believe our existing facilities, both owned and leased, are in good condition and suitable for the conduct of our business. Motorola generally considers the productive capacity of the plants operated by each of its business segments to be adequate and sufficient for the requirements of each business group. The extent of utilization of such manufacturing facilities varies from plant to plant and from time to time during the year.",

         "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nGoogle is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. We aspire to build products and provide services that improve the lives of billions of people globally. Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our innovations in web search and advertising have made our website a top internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in the world.\nOur Motorola business is comprised of two operating segments. The Mobile segment is focused on mobile wireless devices and related products and services. The Home segment is focused on technologies and devices that provide video entertainment services to consumers by enabling subscribers to access a variety of interactive digital television services.\nWe generate revenue primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising. Businesses use our AdWords program to promote their products and services with targeted advertising. In addition, the third parties that comprise the Google Network use our AdSense program to deliver relevant ads that generate revenues and enhance the user experience. We also generate revenues from Motorola by selling hardware products.\nIn December 2012, we entered into an agreement with Arris and certain other persons providing for the disposition of our Motorola Home segment. The transaction is expected to close in 2013.\nTrends in Our Businesses\nAdvertising transactions continue to shift from offline to online as the digital economy evolves. This has contributed to the rapid growth of our business since inception, resulting in substantially increased revenues, and we expect that our business will continue to grow. However, our revenue growth rate has generally declined over time, and it could do so in the future as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, our investments in new business strategies, products, services, and technologies, changes in our product mix, query growth rates and how users make queries, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, and the evolution of the online advertising market, including the increasing variety of online platforms for advertising, and other markets in which we participate.\nMobile search queries and mobile commerce are growing dramatically around the world, and consumers are using multiple devices to access information. Over time these trends have resulted in changes in our product mix, including a significant increase in mobile search queries and a deceleration in the growth of desktop queries. We expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving consumer preferences, as well as by advertising trends, the acceptance by mobile users of our products and services, and our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers in a multi-screen environment. In addition, if there is a further general economic downturn, this may result in fewer commercial queries by our users and may cause advertisers to reduce the amount they spend on online advertising, including the amount they are willing to pay for each click or impression, which could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues. We plan to continue to invest aggressively in our core areas of strategic focus.\nThe main focus of our advertising programs is to provide relevant and useful advertising to our users, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites. These steps include not displaying ads that generate low click-through rates or that send users to irrelevant or otherwise low quality websites, updating our advertising policies and ensuring their compliance, and terminating our relationships with those Google Network Members whose websites do not meet our quality requirements. We may also continue to take steps to reduce the number of accidental clicks by our users. These steps could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues.\nBoth seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenues, as well as aggregate paid click and average cost-per-click growth rates.\nThe operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our Google Network Members’ websites through our AdSense program is significantly lower than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from ads placed on our websites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on Google Network Members’ websites are shared with our Google Network Members. For the past five years, growth in advertising revenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from our Google Network Members’ websites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future, although the relative rate of growth in revenues from our websites compared to the rate of growth in revenues from our Google Network Members’ websites may vary over time. Also, the margins on advertising revenues from mobile devices and other newer advertising formats are generally lower than those from desktop computers and tablets. We expect this trend to continue to pressure our margins, particularly if we fail to realize the opportunities we anticipate with the transition to a dynamic multi-screen environment.\nWe conduct our Motorola business in highly competitive markets, facing both new and established competitors. The markets for many of our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, frequent new product introductions, changing consumer trends, short product life cycles, consumer loyalty and evolving industry standards. Market disruptions caused by new technologies, the entry of new competitors, consolidations among our customers and competitors, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in economic conditions, supply chain interruptions or other factors, can introduce volatility into our businesses. Meeting all of these challenges requires consistent operational planning and execution and investment in technology, resulting in innovative products that meet the needs of our customers around the world.\nFrom an overall business perspective, we continue to invest aggressively in our systems, data centers, corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure, and employees. We increased our hiring in 2012, and we may continue to do so and to provide competitive compensation programs for our employees. Our full-time employee headcount was 32,467 at December 31, 2011 and 53,861 at December 31, 2012, which includes 16,317 headcount from Motorola. Acquisitions will also remain an important component of our strategy and use of capital, and we expect our current pace of acquisitions to continue. We expect our cost of revenues will increase in dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, manufacturing and inventory-related costs, data center costs, content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees, and other costs. In particular, traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may increase in the future if we are unable to continue to improve the monetization or generation of revenues from traffic on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites.\nAs we expand our advertising programs and other products to international markets, we continue to increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates. We have a foreign exchange risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. However, this program will not fully offset the effect of fluctuations on our revenues and earnings.\nResults of Operations\nWe completed our acquisition of Motorola on May 22, 2012 (the acquisition date). The operating results of Motorola were included in our Consolidated Statements of Income from the acquisition date through December 31, 2012. In December 2012, we entered into an agreement for the disposition of the Motorola Home segment and the related financial results are presented as net loss from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nSubsequent to the acquisition in May 2012, we initiated a restructuring plan in our Motorola business. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of this restructuring plan and the associated restructuring charges. We continue to evaluate our plans and further restructuring actions may occur, which may cause us to incur additional restructuring charges, some of which may be significant.\nThe following table presents our historical operating results as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated:\nRevenues\nThe following table presents our revenues, by revenue source, for the periods presented (in millions):\nThe following table presents our revenues, by business, as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented:\nThe following table presents our Google revenues, by revenue source, as a percentage of total Google revenues for the periods presented:\nOur revenues increased $12,270 million from 2011 to 2012. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites and, to a lesser extent, an increase in other revenues driven by hardware product sales. The increase in advertising revenues for Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs, partially offset by a decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic including mobile queries, certain monetization improvements including new ad formats, the continued global expansion of our products, advertisers, and user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network Members. The decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was driven by various factors, such as the general strengthening of the U.S dollar compared to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Euro), the revenue shift mix between Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites, the changes in platform mix due to traffic growth in mobile devices, where the average cost-per-click is typically lower compared to desktop computers and tablets, and the changes in geographical mix due to traffic growth in emerging markets, where the average cost-per-click is typically lower compared to more mature markets.\nIn addition, the increase in our revenues from 2011 to 2012 resulted from the inclusion of revenues from our Motorola Mobile business of $4,136 million.\nOur revenues increased $8,584 million from 2010 to 2011. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites. The increase in advertising revenues for Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic, certain monetization improvements including new ad formats, and the continued global expansion of our products, and our advertiser and user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network Members. The increase in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was primarily driven by the increased spending from advertisers and a general weakening of the U.S dollar compared to foreign currencies (primarily the Euro, Japanese yen, and British pound), partially offset by the\nchanges in geographical mix due to traffic growth in emerging markets, where the average cost-per-click is typically lower, compared to more mature markets. In addition, the increase in advertising revenues for Google Network Members’ websites from 2010 to 2011 was partially offset by the loss of a search partnership and, to a lesser extent, by a search quality improvement made during the first quarter of 2011.\nImprovements in our ability to ultimately monetize increased traffic primarily relate to enhancing the end user experience, including providing end users with ads that are more relevant to their search queries or to the content on the Google Network Members’ websites they visit. For instance, these improvements include increasing site links to be full size links with the URL (uniform resource locator), moving a portion of the first line of the ad to the heading to better promote the content of the ad, providing an option to preview the ad, and moving the ad’s URL to a separate line below the heading for greater page format consistency.\nAggregate paid clicks on Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites increased approximately 34% from 2011 to 2012 and approximately 25% from 2010 to 2011. Average cost-per-click on Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites decreased approximately 12% from 2011 to 2012 and increased approximately 3% from 2010 to 2011. The rate of change in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click, and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors, including the revenue growth rates on our websites compared to those of our Google Network Members, advertiser competition for keywords, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, seasonality, the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs, changes in advertising quality or formats, and general economic conditions. In addition, traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels, including mobile devices, also contributes to these fluctuations. Changes in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click may not be indicative of our performance or advertiser experiences in any specific geographic market, vertical, or industry.\nWe believe that the increase in the number of paid clicks on Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites is substantially the result of our commitment to improving the relevance and quality of both our search results and the advertisements displayed, which we believe results in a better user experience, which in turn results in more searches, advertisers, and Google Network Members and other partners.\nRevenues by Geography\nThe following table presents our Google domestic and international revenues as a percentage of Google revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our customers for our Google business:\nThe following table presents our consolidated domestic and international revenues as a percentage of consolidated revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our customers for our Google business, and shipping addresses of our customers for our Motorola Mobile business:\nThe growth in revenues from the United States as a percentage of consolidated revenues from 2011 to 2012 was primarily as a result of the inclusion of Motorola Mobile revenues which were primarily generated in the United States.\nThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) from 2011 to 2012 had an unfavorable impact on our international revenues. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our revenues from the United Kingdom would have been $68 million or 1.4% higher and our revenues from the rest of the world would have been approximately $1,211 million or 5.6% higher in 2012. This is before consideration of hedging gains of $18 million and $199 million recognized to revenues from the United Kingdom and the rest of the world in 2012.\nThe general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Euro, Japanese yen, and British pound) from 2010 to 2011 had a favorable impact on our international revenues. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our revenues from the United Kingdom would have been $129 million, or 3.2%, lower and our revenues from the rest of the world would have been approximately $834 million, or 5.1%, lower in 2011. This is before consideration of hedging gains of $9 million and $34 million recognized to revenues from the United Kingdom and the rest of the world in 2011.\nAlthough we expect to continue to make investments in international markets, these investments may not result in an increase in our international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2013 or thereafter. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about geographic areas.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately paid to our Google Network Members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search queries to our website (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share and fixed fee arrangements with our Google Network Members and distribution partners.\nCertain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not exclusively-or at all-based on revenue share. These fees are non-refundable. Further, these arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. We recognize fees under these arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points (approximately two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year, or based on any contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenues.\nCost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as content acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our websites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers. We also license content on the pages of our web sites from which the content is sold and share most of the fees these sales generate with content providers. To the extent we are obligated to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to our content providers, we recognize as content acquisition costs the contractual revenue share amount or on a straight-line basis, whichever is greater, over the terms of the agreements.\nIn addition, cost of revenues includes manufacturing and inventory-related costs from our Motorola Mobile business.\nThe following tables present our cost of revenues and cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues by business, and our traffic acquisition costs, and traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues in the Google business, for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nCost of revenues increased $7,446 million from 2011 to 2012. The increase was primarily related to the inclusion of manufacturing and inventory-related costs from our Motorola Mobile business of $3,458 million. Additionally, there was an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $2,145 million resulting from more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program, more traffic directed to our websites, as well as more distribution fees paid. The remaining increase was primarily driven by increase in data center costs, hardware product costs and content acquisition costs. The increase in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily the result of a greater increase in traffic acquisition costs related to distribution arrangements compared to the increase in advertising revenues generated by Google websites. The increase in Google cost of revenues as a percentage of Google revenues was also driven by an increase in hardware product costs.\nCost of revenues increased $2,771 million from 2010 to 2011. The increase was primarily related to an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $1,132 million resulting from more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program. The increase was also related to an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $362 million from our distribution arrangements as a result of more traffic directed to our websites, as well as more distribution fees paid. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of advertising revenues from our websites compared to our Google Network Members’ websites, more revenues realized from Google Network Members to whom we pay less revenue share, and, to a lesser extent, expiration of an AdSense arrangement under which we paid guaranteed minimum revenue share. In addition, there was an increase in data center costs of $784 million, primarily resulting from the depreciation of additional information technology assets and data center buildings and an increase in labor, energy, and bandwidth costs, and an increase in content acquisition costs of $236 million, primarily related to content displayed on YouTube, partially offset by a decrease in mobile phone costs.\nWe expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of total revenues in 2013 and in future periods, primarily as a result of increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, manufacturing and inventory-related costs, content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees, and other costs. Traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors, including the following:\n•\nThe relative growth rates of revenues from our websites and from our Google Network Members’ websites.\n•\nWhether we are able to enter into more AdSense arrangements that provide for lower revenue share obligations or whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential Google Network Members results in less favorable revenue share arrangements.\n•\nWhether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites.\n•\nThe relative growth rates of expenses associated with distribution arrangements and the related revenues generated, including whether we share with certain existing and new distribution partners, including mobile distribution partners, proportionately more of the aggregate advertising fees that we earn from paid clicks derived from search queries these partners direct to our websites.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents our research and development expenses, and research and development expenses as a percentage of our revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel responsible for the research and development of new and existing products and services. We expense research and development costs as incurred.\nResearch and development expenses increased $1,631 million from 2011 to 2012, which includes $710 million related to Motorola Mobile. The remaining increase of $921 million was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $359 million, largely as a result of a 15% increase in research and development headcount, an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $213 million, an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $147 million, and an increase in professional services expense of $66 million.\nResearch and development expenses increased $1,400 million from 2010 to 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $875 million, largely as a result of a 23% increase in research and development headcount, including headcount from acquisitions, as well as an increase in employee base salaries of approximately 10%. In addition, there was an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $200 million.\nWe expect that research and development expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of total revenues in 2013 and future periods because we expect to continue to invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and improve existing, products and services.\nSales and Marketing\nThe following table presents our sales and marketing expenses, and sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel engaged in customer service, sales, and sales support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenditures.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1,554 million from 2011 to 2012, which includes $678 million related to Motorola Mobile. The remaining increase of $876 million was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $390 million, largely as a result of a 14% increase in sales and marketing headcount, as well as an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $288 million. In addition, there was an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $87 million.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1,790 million from 2010 to 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $787 million, largely as a result of a 36% increase in sales and marketing headcount, including headcount from acquisitions, as well as an increase in employee base salaries of approximately 10%. In addition, there was an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $700 million.\nWe expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of total revenues in 2013 and future periods, as we expand our business globally, increase advertising and promotional expenditures in connection with new and existing products, and increase the level of service we provide to our advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe following table presents our general and administrative expenses, and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel and facilities, and include costs related to our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, and legal organizations, and fees for professional services. Professional services are principally comprised of outside legal, audit, information technology consulting, and outsourcing services. General and administrative expenses also include amortization of certain acquired intangible assets.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1,121 million from 2011 to 2012, which includes $364 million related to Motorola Mobile. The remaining increase of $757 million was primarily due to an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets of $274 million, an increase in professional services expense of $147 million, the majority of which was related to legal costs, an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $122 million, primarily as a result of a 11% increase in general and administrative headcount, as well as an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $89 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $762 million from 2010 to 2011. This increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $350 million, primarily as a result of a 37% increase in general and administrative headcount and an increase in employee base salaries of approximately 10%, as well as an increase in expense related to professional services of $260 million, the majority of which were related to consulting services and legal costs. In addition, there was an increase in stock-based compensation of $116 million.\nAs we expand our business and incur additional expenses, we expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of total revenues in 2013 and future periods.\nCharge Related to the Resolution of Department of Justice Investigation\nIn connection with a resolution of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice into the use of Google advertising by certain advertisers, we accrued $500 million during the first quarter of 2011, which was paid in August 2011 upon final resolution of that matter.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table presents our stock-based compensation, and stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nStock-based compensation increased $675 million from 2011 to 2012. This increase was primarily due to additional stock awards issued to existing and new employees, awards issued in connection with the acquisition of Motorola, and acceleration of certain awards resulting from Motorola restructuring. Additionally, stock-based compensation expense for the Motorola Home segment was included in net loss from discontinued operations.\nStock-based compensation increased $598 million from 2010 to 2011. This increase was largely due to additional stock awards issued to existing and new employees.\nWe estimate stock-based compensation to be approximately $2.5 billion in 2013 and $2.7 billion thereafter. This estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after December 31, 2012 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. In addition, to the extent forfeiture rates are different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nInterest and Other Income, Net\nInterest and other income, net, increased $42 million from 2011 to 2012. This increase was primarily driven by a gain on divestiture of business of $188 million in 2012, an impairment charge related to equity investments of $110 million in 2011, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency exchange loss of $152 million and a decrease in interest income of $99 million.\nInterest and other income, net increased $169 million from 2010 to 2011. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest income of $233 million due to an increase in our cash and investment balances and higher yields, as well as an increase in net realized gains on sales of available-for-sale investments of $69 million, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $53 million primarily related to our long-term debt program. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge of $110 million related to certain equity investments during the year ended December 31, 2011.\nThe costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities that we recognized to interest and other income, net are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts, as well as the volatility of the foreign exchange rates.\nAs we expand our international business, we believe costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program may increase in dollar amount in 2013 and future periods.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for income taxes, and effective tax rate for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nOur provision for income taxes increased from 2011 to 2012, primarily as a result of increases in federal income taxes, driven by higher taxable income year over year and expiration of the federal research and development credit, partially offset by proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate decreased from 2011 to 2012, primarily as a result of proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates as well as a discrete item related to an investigation by the Department of Justice recognized in 2011, which was not deductible for income tax purposes.\nOur provision for income taxes increased from 2010 to 2011, primarily as a result of increases in federal income taxes, driven by higher taxable income year over year, partially offset by proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate decreased from 2010 to 2011, primarily as a result of proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates, a decrease in state income taxes, and an increase in federal research and development credits recognized in 2011, partially offset by recognition of a charge related to the resolution of an investigation by the Department of Justice which is not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe federal research and development credit expired on December 31, 2011. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law. Under this act, the federal research and development credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2011 and before January 1, 2014. The effects of these changes in the tax law will result in a tax benefit which will be recognized in the first quarter of 2013, which is the quarter in which the law was enacted.\nOur effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. Our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional information about our provision for income taxes.\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNet Loss from Discontinued Operations\nIn December 2012, we entered into an agreement with Arris and certain other persons providing for the disposition of the Motorola Home business for total consideration of approximately $2.35 billion in cash and common stock, subject to certain adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in 2013. As a result, the\nfollowing financial information of Motorola Home was presented as net loss from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nYou should read the following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. You should also keep in mind that our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year. Please note that previously reported quarters have been adjusted to show discontinued operations for the disposition of the Motorola Home business.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2012. This table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2012:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn summary, our cash flows are as follows (in millions):\nAt December 31, 2012, we had $48.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, and municipalities in the U.S., corporate securities, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities.\nAs of December 31, 2012, $31.4 billion of the $48.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to\naccrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. At December 31, 2012, we had unused letters of credit for approximately $89 million. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. In addition, we may make acquisitions or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund any such acquisitions and licensing activities. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2012, we had $2.5 billion of commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.2% that mature at various dates through 2013. Average commercial paper borrowings during the year were $2.2 billion and the maximum amount outstanding during the year was $2.7 billion. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility and no amounts were outstanding.\nIn May 2011, we issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three equal tranches, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021, with stated interest rates of 1.25%, 2.125%, and 3.625%. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2012, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of these notes were $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion. The estimated fair value was based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of December 31, 2012. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the notes.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including amortization, depreciation, deferred income taxes, excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities, stock-based compensation expense, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2012 was $16,619 million and consisted of net income of $10,737 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $5,172 million, a gain on divestiture of business of $188 million and increase in cash from changes in working capital and other activities of $898 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $2,692 million of stock-based compensation expense, $1,988 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, $974 million of amortization of intangible and other assets, and $188 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities, partially offset by $266 million of deferred income taxes. In addition, the increase in cash from changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of an increase in income taxes, net, of $1,492 million including additional tax obligations accrued, partially offset by an increase in the amount of estimated income taxes we paid during the year, an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $762 million, a decrease in inventories of $301 million, an increase accrued revenue share of $299 million, and an increase in deferred revenue of $163 million. These changes were partially offset by an increase in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets of $833 million including prepayments for certain content arrangements, an increase of accounts receivable of $787 million due to growth in fees billed to our customers, and a decrease in accounts payable of $499 million due to the timing of invoice processing and payments.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2011 was $14,565 million and consisted of net income of $9,737 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $4,198 million, and increase in cash from changes in working capital and other activities of $630 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,974 million of stock-\nbased compensation expense, $1,396 million of depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment, $455 million of amortization of intangible and other assets, $343 million of deferred income taxes, and $110\nmillion related to impairment of equity investments. In addition, the increase in cash from changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $795 million, a net increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes of $731 million, an increase in accrued revenue share of $259 million, an increase of $162 million in deferred revenue, and an increase of $101 million in accounts payable. These increases were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $1,156 million due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers, and an increase in prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets of $262 million. The increase in income taxes payable and deferred income taxes reflected primarily additional tax obligations accrued, partially offset by estimated income taxes paid during 2011. In addition, we paid $500 million related to the resolution of a Department of Justice investigation during the year.\nCash provided by operating activities in 2010 was $11,081 million, and consisted of net income of $8,505 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $2,675 million, and decrease in cash from changes in working capital and other activities of $99 million. Adjustments for non-cash items primarily consisted of $1,376 million of stock-based compensation expense, $1,067 million of depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, and $329 million of amortization of intangible and other assets, partially offset by $94 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities. In addition, the decrease in cash from changes in working capital activities primarily consisted of an increase of $1,129 million in accounts receivable due to the growth in fees billed to our advertisers and an increase of $414 million in prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets. These increases were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $745 million, an increase in accounts payable of $272 million, an increase in accrued revenue share of $214 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $111 million, and a net increase in income tax payable and deferred income taxes of $102 million, which includes the same $94 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities included under adjustments for non-cash items. The increase in accrued expense and other liabilities, accounts payable, accrued revenue share, and deferred revenues are primarily a result of the growth in our business and headcount. The increase in net income taxes payable and deferred income taxes was primarily a result of additional tax obligations accrued, partially offset by the release of certain tax reserves as a result of the settlement of our tax audits for our 2005 and 2006 tax years.\nAs we expand our business internationally, we have offered payment terms to certain advertisers that are standard in their locales but longer than terms we would generally offer to our domestic advertisers. In addition, we continue to evaluate our Motorola restructuring plan, and may incur additional charges, some of which may be significant. This may increase our working capital requirements and may have a negative effect on cash provided by our operating activities.\nCash Used In Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities in 2012 of $13,056 million was primarily attributable to cash used in acquisitions and other investments of $11,264 million, including $9,518 million net cash paid in connection with the acquisition of Motorola, and capital expenditures of $3,273 million related primarily to our facilities, data centers, and related equipment. These decreases were partially offset by net maturities and sales of marketable securities of $1,770 million. Also, in connection with our securities lending program, we returned cash collateral of $334 million. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information about our securities lending program.\nCash used in investing activities in 2011 of $19,041 million was primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of $12,926 million, capital expenditures of $3,438 million related principally to our facilities, data centers, and related equipment, and cash used in acquisitions and other investments of $2,328 million, including $676 million paid in connection with the acquisition of ITA Software, Inc. Also, in connection with our securities lending program, we returned $354 million of cash collateral.\nCash used in investing activities in 2010 of $10,680 million was primarily attributable to net purchases of marketable securities of $6,886 million, capital expenditures of $4,018 million of which $1.8 billion was for the\npurchase of an office building in New York City in December 2010, and remaining amounts related principally to our data centers and related equipment, and cash consideration used in acquisitions and other investments of $1,067 million. Also, in connection with our securities lending program, we received $2,361 million of cash collateral which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements.\nIn order to manage expected increases in internet traffic, advertising transactions, and new products and services, and to support our overall global business expansion, we expect to make significant investments in our systems, data centers, corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure, and employees in 2013 and thereafter. However, the amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis.\nIn addition, we expect to spend a significant amount of cash on acquisitions and other investments from time to time. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product offerings.\nIn December 2012, we signed an agreement for the disposition of Motorola Home business for total consideration of approximately $2.35 billion in cash and stock subject to certain adjustments. We expect the transaction to close in 2013.\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities in 2012 of $1,229 million was primarily driven by net proceeds of $1,328 million from short-term debt issued under our commercial paper program and excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities of $188 million. This was partially offset by net payments for stock-based award activities of $287 million.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2011 of $807 million was primarily driven by net proceeds of $726 million of debt issued and excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities of $86 million.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2010 of $3,050 million was primarily driven by $3,463 million of net cash proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and a promissory note. This was partially offset by $801 million in stock repurchases in connection with our acquisitions of AdMob, Inc. and On2 Technologies, Inc., as well as net proceeds from stock-based award activities of $294 million, and excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities of $94 million.\nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2012\nThe above table does not include future rental income of $649 million related to the leases that we assumed in connection with our building purchases.\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring primarily between 2013 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the above table. Certain of these leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases have adjustments for market provisions.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations represent non-cancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 2012. These contracts are primarily related to distribution arrangements, video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, data center operations and facility build-outs, as well as purchase of inventory.\nLong-term Debt Obligations\nLong-term debt obligations represent principal and interest payments to be made over the life of our unsecured senior notes issued in May 2011. Please see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities consist of cash obligations, primarily the legal settlement with the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers (AAP), asset retirement obligations, and milestone and royalty payments owed in connection with certain acquisitions and licensing agreements.\nIn addition to the amounts above, we had long-term taxes payable of $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2012 related to tax positions for which the timing of the ultimate resolution is uncertain. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table.\nOff-Balance Sheet Entities\nAt December 31, 2012, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nAlthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest.\nOur effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, state taxes, certain benefits realized related to stock-based award activities, and research and experimentation tax credits. The effective tax rates were 21.2%, 21.0%, and 19.4% for 2010, 2011, and 2012. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology; and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nOther estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more fully discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our marketable and non-marketable securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as interest and other income, net.\nPrior period reclassification\nPrior period balance related to inventories has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.",
         "ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nEconomic Exposure\nWe transact business in various foreign currencies and have significant international revenues, as well as costs denominated in foreign currencies. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We purchase foreign exchange option contracts to reduce the volatility of cash flows related to forecasted revenues denominated in certain foreign currencies. The objective of the foreign exchange contracts is to better ensure that the U.S. dollar-equivalent cash flows are not adversely affected by changes in the U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rates. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. The gain on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into revenues when the hedged revenues are recorded or as interest and other income, net, if the hedged transaction becomes probable of not occurring. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $6.5 billion and $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 36 months or less.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% for our foreign currencies instruments could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20%, the amount recorded in AOCI before tax effect would have been approximately $132 million and $9 million lower at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest and other income, net, would have been approximately $138 million and $140 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20%, the amount recorded in accumulated AOCI before tax effect would have been approximately $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion higher at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest and other income, net, would have been approximately $202 million and $159 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012.\nTransaction Exposure\nOur exposure to foreign currency transaction gains and losses is the result of certain net receivables due from our foreign subsidiaries and customers being denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary, primarily the Euro and the British pound. Our foreign subsidiaries conduct their businesses in local currency. We have entered into foreign exchange contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts outstanding was $3.7 billion and $6.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $27 million and $9 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012. The adverse impact at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $503 million and $731 million from foreign exchange contracts in place for the months of December 2011 and December 2012. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe invest our excess cash primarily in U.S. government and its agency securities, money market and other funds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, municipal securities, time deposits, and asset backed securities. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.\nInvestments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our income from investments may decrease in the future. However, we use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate risk of our fixed income securities.\nDuring the second quarter of 2012, we began to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments using forward-starting interest swaps. The total notional amount of these swaps was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2012, with terms calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate. These forward-starting interest swaps effectively fix the benchmark interest rate on an anticipated debt issuance of $1.0 billion in 2014, and they will be terminated upon issuance of the debt.\nWhen entering into forward-starting interest rate swaps, we are subject to market risk with respect to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate that impacts the fair value of the forward-starting interest swaps. We manage market risk by matching the terms of the swaps with the critical terms of the expected debt issuance.\nWe considered the historical volatility of short-term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable securities of approximately $934 million and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2012, after taking into consideration the offsetting effect from interest rate derivative contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and 2012. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis points) decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our forward-starting interest swaps of approximately $107 million at December 31, 2012.",

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nGoogle Inc.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nFinancial Statements:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe supplementary financial information required by this Item 8 is included in Item 7 under the caption “Quarterly Results of Operations.”\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Google Inc.\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Google Inc. at December 31, 2011 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated January 29, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 29, 2013\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Google Inc.\nWe have audited Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Google Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, Google Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2011 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 of Google Inc. and our report dated January 29, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nSan Jose, California\nJanuary 29, 2013\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except share and par value amounts which are reflected in thousands,\nand par value per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(In millions, except for share amounts which are reflected in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Google Inc. and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nWe were incorporated in California in September 1998. We were re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising in our Google segment. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. (Motorola) on May 22, 2012, we generate revenues from sales of mobile devices in our Motorola Mobile (Mobile) segment and digital set-top boxes in our Motorola Home (Home) segment. In December 2012, we entered into an agreement to dispose Home, and the related financial results are presented as net loss from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Assets and liabilities of Motorola Home are not presented as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets because they are not material.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Google Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards, inventory valuations, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table presents our revenues by revenue source (in millions):\nWe recognize revenues when the services or products have been provided or delivered, the fees we charge are fixed or determinable, we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nGoogle\nGoogle AdWords is our auction-based advertising program that enables advertisers to place text-based and display ads on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites. Display advertising comprises the videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets. Most of our customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer advertising on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads display on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites as specified by the advertisers.\nGoogle AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on our Google Network Members’ websites.\nWe recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results or content on our websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. For those advertisers using our cost-per-impression pricing, we recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on our websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. We report our Google AdSense revenues on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisers.\nWe record deferred revenues upon invoicing or when cash payments are received in advance of our performance in the underlying agreement on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMotorola\nFor hardware product sales, where we sell directly to end customers or through distribution channels, revenue recognition generally occurs when products have been shipped, risk of loss has transferred to the customer, objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met, no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts, price protection, returns and customer incentives can be reasonably and reliably estimated. Recorded revenues are reduced by these allowances. Where these allowances cannot be reasonably and reliably estimated, we recognize revenue at the time the product sells through the distribution channel to the end customer.\nFor arrangements that include multiple deliverables, primarily for products that contain software essential to the hardware products’ functionality and services, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, we use a hierarchy to determine the selling prices to be used for allocating revenue: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price, and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable. ESPs reflect our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.\nRevenues from Home are included in net loss from discontinued operations.\nCost of Revenues\nGoogle\nCost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately paid to our Google Network members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or\notherwise direct search queries to our website (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share and fixed fee arrangements with our Google Network Members and distribution partners.\nCertain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not exclusively-or at all-based on revenue share. These fees are non-refundable. Further, these arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. We recognize fees under these arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points (approximately two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year, or based on any contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenues. Further, we review the access points for impairment by distribution partner, type, and geography, and we have not made any impairment to date.\nCost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of acquired intangible assets, as well as content acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our web sites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers. To the extent we are obligated to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to our content providers, we recognize as content acquisition costs the contractual revenue share amount or the minimum guarantee on a straight-line basis, whichever is greater, over the terms of the agreements.\nPrepaid revenue share and distribution fees are included in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMotorola\nCost of revenues from our Motorola business related to delivered hardware, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Cost of revenues from Home are included in net loss from discontinued operations.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe have elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. Shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of RSUs outstanding. Furthermore, we record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us as a reduction to additional paid-in capital when paid. Also, we recognize stock-based compensation using the straight-line method.\nWe include as part of cash flows from financing activities the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax-effected compensation of the related stock-based awards for options exercised and RSUs vested during the period. During the years ended December 31, 2010, December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2012, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $656 million, $621 million, and $736 million, and the total direct tax benefit realized, including the excess tax benefit, from stock-based award activities was $355 million, $451 million, and $747 million. We have elected to account for the indirect effects of stock-based awards-primarily the research and development tax credit-through the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2010, December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2012, we recognized stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefits of $1,376 million and $314 million, $1,974 million and $413 million, and $2,649 million and $591 million. Additionally, net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 includes stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefits of $43 million and $11 million.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nOur revenues are primarily derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, our revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the world. Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, for our Motorola business, nearly all of our Motorola products (other than some prototypes) are manufactured outside the U.S., primarily in China, Taiwan and Brazil.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments and municipalities in the U.S., corporate securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. In 2010, 2011, and 2012, we generated approximately 48%, 46%, and 47% of our revenues from customers based in the U.S., with the majority of customers outside of the U.S. located in Europe and Japan. Many of our Google Network Members are in the internet industry. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend, but generally we do not require collateral from our customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations.\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2010, 2011, and 2012.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial assets and financial liabilities that include cash equivalents, marketable securities, and foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We measure certain other assets including our non-marketable equity securities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Our other current financial assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying value and are therefore not recorded at fair value.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nWe invest our excess cash primarily in time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments and municipalities in the U.S., corporate securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities.\nWe classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities.\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as available-for-sale. We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other-than-temporary, which we record as interest and other income, net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of interest and other income, net.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe have accounted for non-marketable equity securities either under the equity or cost method. Investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee are accounted for under the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our marketable and non-marketable securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as interest and other income, net.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we do not charge interest. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers. We determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, computed using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. We depreciate buildings over periods up to 25 years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property (including land) and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. Depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed to external users, before technological feasibility of such products is reached. We have determined that technological feasibility was reached shortly before the release of those products and as a result, the development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before the release of those products were not material, and accordingly, were expensed as incurred. Software development costs also include costs to develop software programs to be used solely to meet our internal needs. The costs we incurred during the application development stage for these software programs were not material in the years presented.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition. We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the tangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nLong-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review property and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. We have made no material adjustments to our long-lived assets in any of the years presented. In addition, we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired. We found no goodwill impairment in any of the years presented.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one to 12 years.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize income taxes under the liability method. We recognize deferred income taxes for differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity. We recorded $124 million of net translation losses in 2010, $107 million of net translation losses in 2011, and $75 million of net translation gains in 2012. We record net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions as a component of foreign currency exchange losses in interest and other income, net. These gains and losses are net of those recognized on foreign exchange contracts. We recorded $29 million of net losses in 2010, $38 million of net losses in 2011, and $78 million of net losses in 2012.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $772 million, $1,544 million, and $2,332 million.\nPrior Period Reclassification\nPrior period balance related to inventories has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nNote 2. Net Income Per Share of Class A and Class B Common Stock\nWe compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options, warrants issued under the TSO program, and restricted stock units. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, warrants, and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Further, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock (in this case the right of our Class A common stock to receive an equal dividend to any declared on our Class B common stock) must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):\nThe net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.\nNote 3. Financial Instruments\nFair Value Measurements\nWe measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, and foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts at fair value. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. A three-tier fair value hierarchy is established as a basis for considering such assumptions and for inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value:\nLevel 1-Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2-Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nBased on the fair value hierarchy, we classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2. This is because we value our cash equivalents and marketable securities using quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities measured at adjusted cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value by significant investment categories as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 (in millions):\n(1) The balances at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 were cash collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months. See below for further discussion on this program.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method. We recognized gross realized gains of $381 million and $383 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012. We recognized gross realized losses of $127 million and $101 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012. In 2011, we also recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $88 million related to our investment in Clearwire Corporation. We reflect these gains and losses as a component of interest and other income, net, in our accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable securities, excluding marketable equity securities, designated as available-for-sale and classified by the contractual maturity date of the securities (in millions):\nThe following tables present gross unrealized losses and fair values for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):\nSecurities Lending Program\nFrom time to time, we enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income. We loan selected securities which are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities. Cash collateral is invested in reverse repurchase agreements. We classify loaned securities as cash equivalents or marketable securities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We record the cash collateral as an asset with a corresponding liability. We classify reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months as cash equivalents and those longer than three months as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For lending agreements collateralized by securities, we do not record an asset or liability as we are not permitted to sell or repledge the associated collateral.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and our anticipated debt issuance. Our program is not designated for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same company. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We present our derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $113 million and $43 million, which are recorded as accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as interest and other income, net, as part of revenues, or to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe use options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $6.5 billion and $9.5 billion as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 36 months or less.\nDuring the second quarter of 2012, we began to hedge the variability of forecasted interest payments on an anticipated debt issuance using forward-starting interest swaps. The total notional amount of these forward-starting interest swaps was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2012 with terms calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate. These forward-starting interest swaps effectively fix the benchmark interest rate on an anticipated debt issuance of $1.0 billion in 2014, and they will be terminated upon issuance of the debt.\nWe initially report any gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify to revenues or interest expense when the hedged transactions are recorded. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI would be reclassified to interest and other income, net. Further, we exclude the change in the time value of the options from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We record the premium paid or time value of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter, we recognize any change to this time value in interest and other income, net.\nAs of December 31, 2012, the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was $11 million, $10 million of which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI to revenues within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in interest and other income, net, along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in the time value for forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize them in interest and other income, net. The notional principal of these contracts was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of forward and option contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts as well as the related costs in interest and other income, net, along with the gains and losses of the related hedged items. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts outstanding was $3.7 billion and $6.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012.\nWe also use exchange-traded interest rate futures contracts and “To Be Announced” (TBA) forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to hedge interest rate risks on certain fixed income securities. The TBA contracts meet the definition of derivative instruments in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. Our interest rate futures and TBA contracts (together interest rate contracts) are not designated as hedging instruments. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts as well as the related costs in interest and other income, net. The gains and losses are generally economically offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of AOCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from AOCI into interest and other income, net. The total notional amounts of interest rate contracts outstanding were $100 million and $25 million at December 31, 2011 and December, 31, 2012.\nThe fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):\nThe effect of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships on income and other comprehensive income is summarized below (in millions):\n(1) Gains (losses) related to the ineffective portion of the hedges were not material in all periods presented.\nThe effect of derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationships on income is summarized below (in millions):\n(2) Losses related to the amount excluded from effectiveness testing of the hedges were $6 million, $14 million, and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, December 31, 2011, and December 31, 2012.\nThe effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on income is summarized below (in millions):\nNote 4. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, we had $750 million and $2.5 billion of outstanding commercial paper recorded as short-term debt with weighted-average interest rates of 0.1% and 0.2%. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. At December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility, and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012.\nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2011, we had a $468 million secured promissory note outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with an interest rate of 1.0% that matured and was paid in December 2012.\nThe estimated fair value of the short-term debt approximated its carrying value at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012.\nLong-Term Debt\nIn May 2011, we issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three tranches as described in the table below (collectively, the Notes) (in millions):\nThe effective interest yields of the 2014, 2016, and 2021 Notes were 1.258%, 2.241%, and 3.734%, respectively. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 19 and November 19 of each year. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole or from time to time in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes for general corporate purposes. The total estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $3.2 billion at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012. The fair value of the Notes was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in markets that are not active and was categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nAt December 31, 2012, future principal payments for the Notes were as follows (in millions):\nNote 5. Balance Sheet Components\nInventories\nInventories consisted of the following (in millions):\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following (in millions):\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income were as follows (in millions):\nNote 6. Acquisitions\nOn May 22, 2012, we completed our acquisition of Motorola, a provider of innovative technologies, products and services that enable a range of mobile and wireline digital communication, information and entertainment experiences. The acquisition is expected to protect and advance our Android ecosystem and enhance competition in mobile computing. Under the transaction, we acquired all outstanding common shares of Motorola for $40 per share and all vested Motorola stock options and restricted stock units, for a total purchase price of approximately $12.4 billion in cash. In addition, we assumed $401 million of unvested Motorola stock options and restricted stock units, which will be recorded as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining service periods. Transaction costs were approximately $50 million, which were recorded as general and administrative expense as incurred.\nThe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based upon a preliminary valuation and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period. The primary areas of the purchase price that are not yet finalized are related to certain legal matters, income taxes, and residual goodwill. Of the $12.4 billion total purchase price, $2.9 billion was cash acquired, $5.5 billion was attributed to patents and developed technology, $2.5 billion to goodwill, $0.7 billion to customer relationships, and $0.8 billion to other net assets acquired.\nThe goodwill of $2.5 billion is primarily attributed to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nSupplemental information on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the Motorola acquisition had been consummated on January 1, 2011, is presented as follows (in millions, except per share amounts):\n(1) Excludes Home.\nThese pro forma results are based on estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future periods or the results that actually would have been realized had we been a combined company during the periods presented. The pro forma results include adjustments primarily related to amortization of acquired intangible assets, severance and benefit arrangements in connection with the acquisition, and stock-based compensation expenses for assumed unvested stock options and restricted stock units.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2012, we completed 52 other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for a total cash consideration of approximately $1,171 million, of which $733 million was attributed to goodwill, $462 million to acquired intangible assets, and $24 million to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product offerings. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $29 million.\nPro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the aggregate.\nFor all acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2012, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 8.9 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 7.4 years and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 9.0 years.\nNote 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2012 were as follows (in millions):\nAmounts of goodwill allocated to the Mobile and Home segments were not material. See Note 15 for further discussion of segment information.\nInformation regarding our acquisition-related intangible assets is as follows (in millions):\nPatents and developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names and other have weighted-average useful lives from the date of purchase of 8.1 years, 6.6 years, and 5.8 years. Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2011, and 2012 was $314 million, $441 million, and $884 million. For the year ended December 31, 2012, net loss from discontinued operations included $70 million of amortization expense related to Home intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2012, expected amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter was as follows (in millions):\nNote 8. Discontinued Operations\nIn December 2012, we entered into an agreement with Arris Group, Inc. and certain other persons providing for the disposition of the Motorola Home business for total consideration of approximately $2.35 billion in cash and common stock, subject to certain adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in 2013. Financial results of the Motorola Home business are presented as net loss from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table presents financial results of the Motorola Home business for the period from May 22, 2012 to December 31, 2012 (in millions):\nNote 9. Restructuring charges\nSubsequent to our acquisition of Motorola in May 2012, we initiated a restructuring plan primarily in our Mobile segment to reduce workforce, reorganize management structure, close, consolidate and dispose certain facilities, as well as simplify our mobile product portfolio. These changes are designed to return Motorola’s Mobile segment to profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2012, activities related to restructuring charges were summarized as below (in millions):\n(1) Includes restructuring charges related to Home of $55 million.\n(2) Non-cash items were primarily related to RSUs, stock options and asset impairments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2012, restructuring charges were included in costs and expenses as follows (in millions):\nRestructuring charges related to Home of $55 million were included in net loss from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe continue to evaluate our plans and further restructuring actions may occur which may cause us to incur additional restructuring charges, some of which may be significant.\nNote 10. Interest and Other Income, Net\nThe components of interest and other income, net were as follows (in millions):\nNote 11. Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring primarily between 2013 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table below. Certain of these arrangements have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis.\nAt December 31, 2012, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases, net of sublease income amounts, were as follows over each of the next five years and thereafter (in millions):\nCertain leases have adjustments for market provisions. Amounts in the above table represent our best estimates of future payments to be made under these leases. In addition, the above table does not include future rental income of $649 million related to the leases that we assumed in connection with our building purchases. Rent expense under operating leases, including co-location arrangements, was $293 million, $380 million, and $448 million in 2010, 2011, and 2012.\nPurchase Obligations\nAt December 31, 2012, we had $2.1 billion of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, primarily related to certain of our distribution arrangements, video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, as well as data center operations and facility build-outs.\nLetters of Credit\nAt December 31, 2012, we had unused letters of credit for $89 million, of which $45 million related to our Mobile segment.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network Members, and lessors with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such\nagreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of December 31, 2012, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.\nLegal Matters\nAntitrust Investigations\nIn June 2011, we received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) Bureau of Competition and a subpoena from the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection relating to a review by the FTC of our business practices, including search and advertising. In June 2012, we also received a CID and a subpoena duces tecum from the FTC’s Bureau of Competition seeking documents and information broadly related to Motorola’s licensing practices for standards-essential patents and use of standards-essential patents in litigation. In January 2013, the FTC closed its investigations into our business practices, including search and advertising. In connection with the closing of the investigation, we have voluntarily agreed to make certain product changes. In addition, we and Motorola have entered into a consent order with the FTC setting forth certain guidelines on our use of standards-essential patents in litigation.\nState attorneys general from the states of Texas, Ohio, and Mississippi have issued similar CIDs relating to our business practices. We are cooperating with the state attorneys general and are responding to their information requests on an ongoing basis.\nThe European Commission’s (EC) Directorate General for Competition has also opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. Since February 2010, we have received a number of notifications from the EC about antitrust complaints filed against us. On November 30, 2010, the EC formally opened proceedings against us. We believe we have adequately responded to all of the allegations made against us. We continue to cooperate with the EC and are pursuing a potential resolution that would avoid a finding of infringement and a fine. The EC has also opened an investigation into Motorola’s licensing practices for standards-essential patents and use of standards-essential patents in litigation on the basis of complaints brought by Microsoft and Apple. We are cooperating with the EC and responding to the information requests on an ongoing basis.\nThe Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia in Argentina, the Competition Commission of India, and the Korea Fair Trade Commission in South Korea have also opened investigations into certain business practices.\nEPA Investigation\nIn February 2009, we learned of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation into an alleged release of refrigerant at one of our smaller data center facilities, which we acquired from DoubleClick, and the accuracy of related statements and records. We are cooperating with the EPA and have provided documents and other materials.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies, including Android, Google Search, Google AdWords, Google AdSense, Google Books, Google News, Google Image Search, Google Chrome, Google Talk, Google Voice, Motorola devices and YouTube, infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business\npractices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an ITC action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Since the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.\nIn December 2012, we announced that Motorola Mobility had entered into an agreement with Arris Group, Inc. and certain other persons providing for the disposition of Motorola’s Home business for total consideration of approximately $2.35 billion, subject to certain adjustments. Under the agreement, we have agreed to indemnify Arris Group for potential liability from certain intellectual property infringement litigation, including, among others, a patent infringement claim brought by TiVo relating to certain digital video recording equipment sold by Motorola Mobility.\nOther\nWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust (such as the pending investigations by the FTC and the EC described above), intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.\nCertain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.\nWith respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various other tax authorities. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of tax benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\nNote 12. Stockholders’ Equity\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nOur board of directors has authorized 100,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. At December 31, 2011 and 2012, there were no shares issued or outstanding.\nClass A and Class B Common Stock\nOur board of directors has authorized two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. At December 31, 2012, there were 9,000,000,000 and 3,000,000,000 shares authorized and there were 267,448,281 and 62,530,474 shares outstanding of Class A and Class B common stock, $0.001 par value. The rights of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock. We refer to Class A and Class B common stock as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nStock Dividend\nIn April 2012, our board of directors approved amendments to our certificate of incorporation that would, among other things, create a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock). The amendments authorized 3 billion shares of Class C capital stock and also increased the authorized shares of Class A common stock from 6 billion to 9 billion. The amendments are reflected in our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (New Charter), the adoption of which was approved by stockholders at our 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 21, 2012. We have announced the intention of our board of directors to consider a distribution of shares of the Class C capital stock as a dividend to our holders of Class A and Class B common stock (Dividend). The Class C capital stock will have no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Except as expressly provided in the New Charter, shares of Class C capital stock will have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and be identical in all other respects to the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock as to all matters.\nThe par value per share of our shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will remain unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Dividend. On the effective date of the Dividend, there will be a transfer between retained earnings and common stock and the amount transferred will be equal to the $0.001 par value of the Class C capital stock that is issued. We will give retroactive effect to prior period share and per share amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the effect of the Dividend, such that prior periods are comparable to current period presentation.\nStock Plans\nWe maintain the 1998 Stock Plan, the 2000 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan (No. 2), the 2003 Stock Plan (No. 3), the 2004 Stock Plan, and plans assumed through acquisitions, all of which are collectively referred to as the “Stock Plans.” Under our Stock Plans, incentive and non-qualified stock options or rights to purchase common stock may be granted to eligible participants. Options are generally granted for a term of 10 years. Under the Stock Plans, we have also issued RSUs. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our stock at the time the award vests. Except for options granted pursuant to our stock option exchange program completed in March 2009 (the Exchange), options granted and RSUs issued to participants under the Stock Plans generally vest over four years contingent upon employment or service with us on the vesting date.\nAt December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012, there were 21,794,492 and 15,833,050 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plans.\nWe estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the BSM option pricing model. Our assumptions about stock-price volatility have been based exclusively on the implied volatilities of publicly traded options to buy our stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life of options granted to our employees. We estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock options granted in the periods presented:\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our options for the year ended December 31, 2012:\n(1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the closing stock price of $707.38 of our Class A common stock on December 31, 2012.\n(2) Includes options granted in connection with the acquisition of Motorola.\n(3) Options expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nThe following table summarizes additional information regarding outstanding, exercisable, and exercisable and vested stock options at December 31, 2012:\nThe above tables include approximately 1.6 million warrants held by selected financial institutions that were options purchased from employees under our TSO program, with a weighted-average exercise price of $363.66 and a weighted-average remaining life of 1.3 years.\nDuring 2012, the number of shares underlying TSOs sold to selected financial institutions under the TSO program was 1,226,983 at a total value of $365 million, or an average of $297.28 per share, including an average premium of $9.35 per share. The premium is calculated as the difference between (a) the sale price of the TSO and (b) the intrinsic value of the TSO, which we define as the excess, if any, of the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the sale over the exercise price of the TSO.\nThe total grant date fair value of stock options vested during 2010, 2011, and 2012 was $690 million, $561 million, and $489 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of all options and warrants exercised during 2010, 2011, and 2012 was $794 million, $674 million, and $827 million. These amounts do not include the aggregate sales price of options sold under our TSO program.\nAs of December 31, 2012, there was $386 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding employee stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.2 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2012:\n(1) Includes RSUs granted in connection with the acquisition of Motorola.\n(2) RSUs expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nAs of December 31, 2012, there was $4.8 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nNote 13. 401(k) Plans\nWe have two 401(k) Savings Plans (401(k) Plans) that qualify as deferred salary arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these 401(k) Plans, matching contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’ contributions subject to certain limitations. We contributed approximately $100 million, $136 million, and $180 million during 2010, 2011, and 2012.\nNote 14. Income Taxes\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $4,948 million, $4,693 million, and $5,311 million for 2010, 2011, and 2012, and income from foreign operations of $5,848 million, $7,633 million, and $8,075 million for 2010, 2011, and 2012. Substantially all of the income from foreign operations was earned by an Irish subsidiary.\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions):\nThe reconciliation of federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):\nWe have not provided U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of December 31, 2012, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $33.3 billion. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.\nDeferred Tax Assets\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2012, our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $1,048 million, $333 million and $384 million. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2017 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2013. The foreign net operating loss can be carried forward indefinitely, however it is more likely than not that it will not be realized, therefore we have recorded a full valuation allowance. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar limitations under the tax laws of the foreign jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2012, our California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $146 million that can be carried over indefinitely. We believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the state tax credit will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance on the state tax credit carryforward in the amount of $130 million. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nAs of December 31, 2012, our federal and state capital loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $483 million and $612 million. We also have deferred tax assets for impairment losses that, if recognized, will be capital in nature. We believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets for capital losses and impairment losses will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance on both our\nfederal and state deferred tax assets for these items in the amount of $205 million. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nIn December 2012, we entered into an agreement with Arris Group Inc. (Arris) for the disposition of the Motorola Home business. A deferred tax asset was established for the book to tax basis difference in our investment in the Motorola Home Business upon signing the agreement. When the disposition event actually occurs in the foreseeable future, some or all of the basis difference in the Home business will become a basis difference in Google’s investment in Arris. Since any future losses to be recognized upon sale of the Home business or Arris Shares will be capital losses and Google already has an excess capital loss carryforward, a full valuation allowance was recorded against this deferred tax asset. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2012 (in millions):\nOur total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $951 million, $1,350 million, and $1,749 million as of December 31, 2010, 2011, and 2012.\nAs of December 31, 2011 and 2012, we had accrued $129 million and $139 million for payment of interest and penalties. Interest and penalties included in our provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.\nWe and our subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. Although we file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns, our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and Ireland. During the three months ended December 31, 2007, the IRS completed its examination of our 2003 and 2004 tax years. We have filed an appeal with the IRS for certain issues related to this audit and settlements were reached in 2012 on all but one issue which we plan to litigate in court. As a result we released the related reserves in the three month ended December 31, 2012. The IRS is currently in examination of our 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years. We expect the examination to be completed within the next 12 months, but we do not anticipate any significant impact to our unrecognized tax benefit balance as of December 31, 2012, related to our 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years.\nOur 2010, 2011 and 2012 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes, and our 2006 through 2012 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are various other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\nNote 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nPrior to the second quarter of 2012, our chief operating decision makers (i.e., the chief executive officer and his direct reports) reviewed financial information presented on a consolidated basis, accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by geographic region for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. As a result of our Motorola acquisition in the second quarter of 2012, our chief operating decision makers review financial information for the following three operating segments:\n•\nGoogle-includes our advertising and other non-advertising businesses\n•\nMobile-includes our mobile devices business acquired from Motorola\n•\nHome-includes our digital set-top box business acquired from Motorola\nIn December 2012, as a result of an agreement for the disposition of the Home segment, the Home segment is presented as discontinued operations and therefore is not included in the segment report.\nOur chief operating decision makers do not evaluate operating segments using asset information.\nThe following table sets forth revenues and operating income (loss) by operating segment (in millions):\nA reconciliation of the total segment income from operations to the consolidated income from operations is as follows (in millions):\nUnallocated items, including stock-based compensation expense, restructuring and other charges related to our Mobile segment, and a charge related to the resolution of a Department of Justice investigation, are not allocated to each segment because we do not include this information in our measurement of the performance of our operating segments.\nRevenues by geography are based on the billing addresses of our customers for the Google segment and the ship-to-addresses of our customers for the Mobile segment. The following tables set forth revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area (in millions):\n(1) Includes Home segment.",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2012 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2012. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.",

         "ITEM 1.\nBUSINESS\nOverview\nGoogle is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. We aspire to build products and provide services that improve the lives of billions of people globally. Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our innovations in web search and advertising have made our website a top internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Our Google segment generates revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising. Businesses use our AdWords program and AdSense program to promote their products and services with advertising on both Google-owned properties and publishers' sites across the web.\nOur Motorola Mobile segment is focused on mobile wireless devices and related products and services. In January 2014, we entered into an agreement with Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo), a Hong Kong corporation, providing for the disposition of our Motorola Mobile segment. The transaction is expected to close in 2014.\nOur business is primarily focused around the following key areas: search and display advertising, the Android operating system platform, consumer content through Google Play, enterprise, commerce and hardware products.\nWe were incorporated in California in September 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware in August 2003. Our headquarters are located at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, and our telephone number is (650) 253-0000. We completed our initial public offering in August 2004 and our Class A common stock is currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG.”\nOn January 30, 2014, we announced that our board of directors had approved a distribution of shares of our Class C capital stock as a dividend to our stockholders with a dividend record date of March 27, 2014 and a dividend payment date of April 2, 2014. On the first trading day expected to be April 3, 2014, Class C will be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"GOOG\" and Class A will be listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \"GOOGL.\"\n2013 Corporate Highlights\n•\nAndroid - Our Android operating system continues to grow with more than a billion Android devices activated globally as of September 2013.\n•\nGoogle Play - Google Play is an entirely cloud-based, digital entertainment store with more than a million apps and games plus millions of songs and books and thousands of movies that our users can find, enjoy and share on their computer, phone or tablet. Our new music subscription service, All Access, lets people listen to more than 20 million songs for $9.99 a month on any device.\n•\nChromebooks and Chrome - Chromebooks are computers that are built for the way people work and live today. Chromebooks, like the Chrome browser, are built around the core tenets of speed, simplicity, and security. Today, eight of the top computer manufacturers are making Chromebooks, and Chromebooks are used in more than 5,000 schools. Chrome has made browsing the web simpler, speedier and safer for more than 750 million users around the world.\n•\nChromecast - To help make it easy to bring users’ favorite online entertainment to the biggest screen in their house - the TV - we introduced Chromecast. Chromecast is a small and affordable device that users simply plug into their high-definition (HD) TV and it allows users to use their phone, tablet or laptop to \"cast\" online content to their TV screen. It works with Netflix, YouTube, Google Play Movies & TV, Google Play Music, HBO Go, Hulu Plus and Pandora. With Chromecast, we wanted to create an easy solution that works for everyone, for every TV in the house.\n•\nNexus - We launched Nexus 5, our newest smartphone, in October 2013, that features an intelligently simple design that is precision-built from strong materials. It comes in black, white and red and has a 5” HD display, Snapdragon 800 processor, 4G/LTE and built-in wireless charging. In July 2013, we also launched a refreshed Nexus 7 tablet. The thinner, lighter and faster Nexus 7 delivers the perfect mix of power and portability. It features the world’s sharpest 7\" tablet screen - putting over 2.3M pixels in the palm of each user’s hand.\n•\nGoogle Now - We continue to improve Google Now, which brings users information they want, when they need it. In 2013, we added a number of new cards for car rentals, concert tickets, commute sharing, NCAA football\nand new reminders, as well as improved public transit and updated TV cards, all appearing automatically throughout the day on any device at the moment users need them.\n•\nAds - We introduced Enhanced Campaigns in February 2013 as a new way for advertisers to more easily create campaigns that run across multiple devices in AdWords. In addition, we launched Estimated Total Conversions, which helps our advertisers measure the full influence of their online campaigns as users move across multiple screens.\nOn January 29, 2014, we entered into an acquisition agreement with Lenovo to sell our Motorola Mobile segment. Google will retain the vast majority of Motorola Mobile's patent portfolio, which will be licensed back to Motorola Mobile for its continued operations. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, Lenovo will acquire Motorola Mobile for total consideration of (i) $660 million in cash, subject to adjustments for working capital, deferred revenue and net debt, (ii) $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares, based on the Lenovo share price at closing and (iii) a $1.5 billion interest free, three-year prepayable promissory note. We expect the transaction to close in 2014.\nSearch\nGoogle Search continues to evolve and improve as more information comes online, and as people increasingly look to their mobile devices for answers throughout the day. While on the go, users can now ask questions of the Google Search app on Android and iOS in natural language and get answers - \"Where’s my package? Do I need a jacket this weekend? Who built the Eiffel Tower? What year was it constructed?\"\nTo enable this, we've expanded and improved our Knowledge Graph, which allows users to search for things, people or places that Google knows about, and built systems that recognize speech accurately and understand natural language. As described above, we are also making Google Now more useful, adding more kinds of cards that help with everything from car rentals, to concert tickets, to commute sharing, to reminders users can set for a specific place - so, for example, users can say \"Remind me to pick up milk when I get to Shop Rite,\" and they will get a reminder when they get to the store.\nIn addition, we are constantly improving and adding to our products and services, to provide users with more relevant results so that users find what they are looking for faster. We also offer Product Listing Ads, which include richer product information, such as product image, price, and merchant information, without requiring additional keywords or ad text.\nAdvertising\nThe goal of AdWords, our primary auction-based advertising program, is to deliver ads that are so useful and relevant to search queries or web content that they are a form of information in their own right. With AdWords, advertisers create simple text-based ads that appear beside related search results or web content on our websites and on thousands of partner websites in our Google Network, which is the network of third parties that use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads with their search results and content. Most of our AdWords customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer AdWords on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads appear on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites as specified by the advertiser.\nOur AdSense program enables websites that are part of the Google Network to deliver ads from our AdWords advertisers that are relevant to the search results or content on their websites. We share the majority of the revenues generated from these ads with the Google Network Members that display the ads. The AdSense program enables advertisers to extend the reach of their ad campaigns, improves our partners’ ability to generate revenue from their content, and delivers relevant ads for their users.\nAs consumers increasingly live their lives across multiple screens, we introduced enhanced campaigns in AdWords to help advertisers big and small create relevant campaigns across all devices more easily. All of the more than one million AdWords advertisers are now using this new system, and the feedback we have gotten from marketers has been very positive.\nDisplay advertising comprises the videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets. The Google Display Network provides advertisers services related to the delivery of display advertising across publishers participating in our AdSense program, publishers participating in the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, and Google-owned sites such as YouTube and Google Finance.\nThrough our DoubleClick advertising technology, we provide to publishers, agencies, and advertisers the ad serving technology, which is the infrastructure that enables billions of ads to be served each day across the web. Our DoubleClick Ad Exchange creates a real-time auction marketplace for the trading of display ad space. We aim to simplify display advertising so it is easier for advertisers and publishers to manage campaigns across different screens and formats.\nIn addition, YouTube provides a range of video, interactive, and other ad formats for advertisers to reach their intended audience. YouTube’s video advertising solutions give advertisers a way to promote their content to the YouTube community, as well as to associate with content being watched by their target audience. YouTube also offers analytic tools to help advertisers understand their audience and derive general business intelligence. In the past year, YouTube has experienced strong growth in mobile viewers and has established key partnerships with content companies to help monetize mobile video.\nConsumer Content and Platforms\nAndroid. Working closely with the Open Handset Alliance, a business alliance of more than 75 technology and mobile companies, we developed Android, a free, fully open source mobile software platform that any developer can use to create applications for mobile devices and any handset manufacturer can install on a device. We believe Android will drive greater innovation and choice in the mobile device ecosystem, and provide consumers with a more powerful mobile experience.\nChromebook, Chrome, and Chromecast. As mentioned above, we launched several new hardware products this year including multiple Chromebooks, Nexus 5 (smartphone), Nexus 7 (7\" tablet), and Chromecast (device allowing the consumer to \"cast\" online content to their TV screen), all of which received extremely positive user feedback.\nGoogle+. Google+ allows users to share online just like users do in the real world, sharing different things with different people. As of October 2013, we had 540 million 30-day active users across our Google properties.\nGoogle Play. Google Play is our digital entertainment store for apps, music, books and movies. We also launched our All Access music service this year which allows users to listen to our vast music library. This year we brought Google Play to more platforms so Play Music, Play Movies and Play Books can now be enjoyed on the iPhone and iPad, in addition to Android devices.\nGoogle Drive. Google Drive is a place where users can create, share, collaborate, and keep all of their stuff. Google Docs is built right into Google Drive so users can work with others in real time on documents, spreadsheets and presentations and users’ files go everywhere they do. When users change a file on the web, on their computer, or on their mobile device, the file updates on every device where users have installed Google Drive.\nGoogle Wallet. Google Wallet is a virtual wallet that securely stores users’ credit and debit cards, offers, and rewards cards. Users can tap their phone to pay in-store using Google Wallet anywhere contactless payments are accepted. Users can also easily pay online and on their mobile devices at participating merchant sites and apps using Google Wallet. People can also easily send money to their friends through Gmail or through the Google Wallet app.\nEnterprise\nWith Google's Enterprise products, we help users work the way they live by enhancing our consumer products used by billions with the features and controls their business needs to be productive, innovative and successful. These tools such as Google Apps (which includes Gmail, Google Drive, Calendar, Google Sites, and more) are built to let people work anywhere, anytime, on any device, without loss of security or control. We also provide versions of our Google Maps Application Programming Interface (API) for businesses (including fully interactive Google Maps for public and internal websites), as well as Google Earth Enterprise (a behind-the-company-firewall software solution for imagery and data visualization).\nWe now also offer infrastructure and cloud services to developers and businesses with Google Cloud Platform. This suite of services includes a Platform as a Service (PAAS) offering called Google App Engine, storage through Google Cloud Storage, real time analytics through Google BigQuery, Structured Query Language (SQL) through Google Cloud SQL, and Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS) via Google Compute Engine.\nMotorola\nThe Motorola Mobile segment is focused on mobile wireless devices and related products and services and generates revenues primarily by selling hardware products. In January 2014, we entered into an agreement with\nLenovo providing for the disposition of our Motorola Mobile segment.\nResearch\nWe continue to develop new products and services and to enhance our existing ones through research and product development and the licensing and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology. Our product development philosophy is to launch innovative products early and often, and then iterate rapidly to make those products even better. We often post early-stage products at test locations online or directly on Google.com. We then use data and user feedback to decide if and how to invest further in those products.\nOur research and development expenses were $5.2 billion, $6.8 billion, and $8.0 billion in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively, which included stock-based compensation expense of $1.1 billion, $1.3 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively. We expect to continue to invest in building the employee and systems infrastructure needed to support the development of new products and services and to improve existing ones.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology. Over time, we have assembled a portfolio of patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names, and trade secrets covering our products and services. Our proprietary technology is not dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights. We believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products. Although we rigorously protect our proprietary technology, any significant impairment of, or third-party claim against, our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.\nSales and Support\nWe continue to develop and grow our sales and support infrastructure. We have over 85 offices in over 50 countries, the large majority of which include sales people. Our global sales and support infrastructure has specialized teams across vertical markets. We bring businesses into our advertising network through direct, remote, and online sales channels, using technology and automation wherever possible to improve our customers’ experience and to grow our business cost-effectively. Our direct advertising and sales teams focus on building relationships with the largest advertisers and leading internet companies. We have built a multi-product sales force, with teams selling campaigns that include search and display (including video) that appear on multiple devices used by consumers.\nWe provide customer service to our advertiser base through our global support organization. Our global support organization concentrates on helping our advertisers and Google Network Members get the most out of their relationship with us.\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2011, 2012, or 2013.\nGovernment Contracts\nNo material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government.\nMarketing\nGoogle’s global brand is well known. We believe that building a trusted, highly recognized brand begins with providing high-quality products and services that make a notable difference in people’s lives. Our marketing, promotional, and public relations activities are designed to promote Google’s brand image and differentiate it from competitors.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change and converging, as well as new and disruptive, technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with information on the web and provide them with relevant advertising. We face competition from:\n•\nGeneral purpose search engines, such as Yahoo and Microsoft’s Bing.\n•\nVertical search engines and e-commerce websites, such as Kayak (travel queries), Monster.com (job queries), WebMD (health queries), and Amazon.com and eBay (e-commerce). Some users will navigate directly to such websites rather than go through Google.\n•\nSocial networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. Some users are relying more on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through general purpose search engines.\n•\nOther forms of advertising, such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, and yellow pages, for ad dollars. Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n•\nMobile applications on iPhone and Android devices, which allow users to access information directly from a publisher without using search engines.\n•\nProviders of online products and services. A number of our online products and services, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs, compete directly with new and established companies, which offer communication, information, and entertainment services integrated into their products or media properties.\nWe compete to attract and retain users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, primarily on the basis of the relevance and usefulness of our search results and the features, availability, and ease of use of our products and services.\nWe also compete to attract and retain content providers (Google Network Members, as well as other content providers for whom we distribute or license content), primarily based on the size and quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous domestic and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matter. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future and any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nCulture and Employees\nWe take great pride in our culture. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex technical challenges. Transparency and open dialog are central to us, and we like to ensure that company news reaches our employees first through internal channels.\nDespite our rapid growth, we still cherish our roots as a startup and give employees the freedom to act on their ideas regardless of role or function within the company. We strive to hire the best employees, with backgrounds and perspectives as diverse as our global users. We provide an environment where these talented people can have fulfilling careers working on some of the biggest challenges in technology, and have a huge, positive impact on the world.\nAt December 31, 2013, we had 47,756 full-time employees, consisting of 18,593 in research and development, 15,348 in sales and marketing, 6,563 in general and administrative, and 7,252 in operations. All of Google’s full-time employees are also equity holders, with significant collective employee ownership. Although we have works councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff.\nGlobal Operations and Geographic Data\nWe provide our products and services in more than 100 languages and in more than 50 countries, regions, and territories. On www.google.com or one of our other Google domains, users can find information in many different languages and in many different formats. The United States accounted for approximately 45% of our revenues in 2013. Information regarding financial data by geographic areas is set forth in Item 7 and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly\nresults, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.google.com, and our investor relations website is located at http://investor.google.com. The following filings are available through our investor relations website after we file them with the SEC: Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our Proxy Statements for our annual meetings of stockholders, for the last three years. These filings are also available for download free of charge on our investor relations website. We also provide a link to the section of the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov that has all of our public filings, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, all amendments to those reports, our Proxy Statements, and other ownership related filings. Further, a copy of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is located at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. Information on the operation of the Public Reference Room can be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.\nWe webcast our earnings calls and certain events we participate in or host with members of the investment community on our investor relations website. Additionally, we provide notifications of news or announcements regarding our financial performance, including SEC filings, investor events, press and earnings releases, and blogs as part of our investor relations website as well as on our investor relations Google+ page (https://plus.google.com/+GoogleInvestorRelations/posts). Investors and others can receive notifications of new information posted on our investor relations website in real time by signing up for email alerts and RSS feeds. Further corporate governance information, including our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, governance guidelines, board committee charters, and code of conduct, is also available on our investor relations website under the heading “Corporate Governance.” The content of our websites are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC, and any references to our websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.",
         "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and is subject to changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to compete successfully depends heavily on providing products and services that make using the internet a more useful and enjoyable experience for our users and delivering innovative products and technologies to the marketplace. As our business has evolved, the competitive pressure to innovate will now encompass a wider range of products and services, including products and services that may be outside of our historical core business.\nWe have many competitors in different industries, including general purpose search engines, vertical search engines and e-commerce sites, social networking sites, traditional media companies, wireless mobile device companies, and providers of online products and services. Our current and potential competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Established companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users, and they can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, investing aggressively in research and development, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious) and competing aggressively for advertisers and websites. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can.\nOur competitors are constantly developing innovations in web search, online advertising, wireless mobile devices, and web-based products and services. The research and development of new, technologically advanced products is\nalso a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment, as well as the accurate anticipation of technology, market trends and consumer needs. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our web search technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. If we are unable to provide quality products and services, then acceptance rates for our products and services could decline and affect consumer and advertiser perceptions of our brand. In addition, these new products and services may present new and difficult technological and legal challenges, and we may be subject to claims if users of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other issues. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, and Google Network Members, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities, or are not effectively brought to market. As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer user experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, and content providers, our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our ongoing businesses.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nMore people are using devices other than personal computers to access the internet and accessing new platforms to make search queries. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our web search technology, products, or operating systems developed for these devices, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access the internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets, video game consoles, and television set-top devices, is increasing dramatically. The lower resolution, functionality, and memory associated with some alternative devices make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users, manufacturers, or distributors of alternative devices. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via “apps” tailored to particular devices or social media platforms, which could affect our share of the search market over time. As new devices and platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, distributors, and users to our products and services, or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms, we will fail to capture the opportunities available as consumers and advertisers transition to a dynamic, multi-screen environment.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and a reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could seriously harm our business.\nWe generated 91% of Google revenues from our advertisers in 2013. Our advertisers can generally terminate their contracts with us at any time. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in advertising with us does not generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, or if we do not deliver their advertisements in an appropriate and effective manner. If we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertisers, they may stop placing ads with us, which would adversely affect our revenues and business.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on the demand for\nadvertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, which could adversely affect our revenues and business.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including as a result of:\n•\nincreasing competition,\n•\nchanges in property mix, platform mix and geographical mix,\n•\nthe challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels,\n•\nthe evolution of the online advertising market, including the increasing variety of online platforms for advertising, and the other markets in which we participate and\n•\nthe success of our investments in new businesses, products, services, and technologies.\nThe revenue growth rate of our Motorola Mobile segment will also depend on a number of factors, including the success of our new products, our reliance on several large customers, the absence of long-term exclusivity arrangements with such customers, our ability to gain significant market share in the mobile devices space, our reliance on third-party distributors, representatives and retailers to sell certain of our products and the successful implementation of our product and operating system strategies. Furthermore, consolidation in the telecommunications industry could negatively impact our business because there would be fewer network operators and it could be more difficult to replace any lost customers. Any of these factors could have a negative impact on our Motorola Mobile segment and have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results.\nWe believe our operating margin will experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for many aspects of our business, including Motorola, and new lines of business. For instance, our operating margin will experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our Google Network Members' websites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on our own websites or if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote the distribution of certain products, including Google Chrome. Both the margin on revenues we generate from our Google Network Members and the margin on revenues from our Motorola business are significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites. Also, the margins on advertising revenues from mobile devices and newer advertising formats are generally less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites. Additionally, the margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network Members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google Network Members.\nWe are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business.\nThe growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields implicate a variety of new regulatory issues, and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown. We continue to cooperate with the European Commission (EC), other international regulatory authorities, and several state attorneys general in investigations they are conducting with respect to our business and its impact on competition. Legislators and regulators, including those conducting investigations in the U.S. and Europe, may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material ways.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust (such as the pending investigations by the EC), intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. The sale of hardware products also exposes us to the risk of product liability and other litigation involving assertions about product defects, as well as health and safety, hazardous materials usage, and other environmental concerns. In addition, our businesses face intellectual property litigation, as further discussed later, that exposes us to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell products and services.\nSuch claims, suits, government investigations, and proceedings are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, such legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in our business practices or product recalls or other field action, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:\n•\nDiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges.\n•\nFailure to successfully further develop the acquired business or technology.\n•\nImplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.\n•\nIntegration of the acquired company's accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions.\n•\nTransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.\n•\nFailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval, under competition and antitrust laws which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition.\n•\nIn the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\n•\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire.\n•\nLiability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.\n•\nLitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\nOur acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or results. Also, the anticipated benefit of many of our acquisitions may not materialize.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners.\nThe brand identity that we have developed has significantly contributed to the success of our business.\nMaintaining and enhancing the “Google” brand is critical to expanding our base of users, advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase due to the relatively low barriers to entry in the internet market. Our brand may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including data protection and security issues, service outages, and product malfunctions. If we fail to maintain and enhance the “Google” brand, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results, and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to be a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality innovative products and services, which we may not do successfully.\nA variety of new and existing U.S. and foreign laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nFurthermore, many of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and related technologies and, as a result, do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies. The laws that do reference the internet are being interpreted by the courts, but their applicability and scope remain uncertain. For example, the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the U.S. and abroad. Claims have also been, or may be, threatened and filed against us under both U.S. and foreign laws for defamation, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users, our products and services, or content generated by our users. Moreover, current and new patent laws such as U.S. patent laws and European patent laws may affect the ability of companies, including us, to protect their innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement.\nIn addition, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for caching or hosting, or for listing or linking to, third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Any future legislation impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact us. Various U.S. and international laws restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors. In the area of data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California's Information Practices Act. We face similar risks and costs as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations.\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property or other claims, which are costly to defend, could result in significant damage awards, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nInternet, technology, media, and other companies own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As we have grown, the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies.\nWe have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies, including Android, Google Search, Google AdWords, Google AdSense, Motorola products, Google Maps, Google Books, Google News, Google Image Search, Google Chrome, Google Talk, Google Voice, and YouTube, among others, infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.\nIn addition, many of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business. Moreover, supplier provided intellectual property indemnities to us, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers from covered products.\nRegardless of the merits of the claims, intellectual property claims are often time consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and cause significant diversion of management attention. To the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful, they may have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective.\nAlthough we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, because of our long-term interests in open source, we may not have adequate patent protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.\nWe also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.\nWe may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.\nWe host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat unsettled both within the U.S. and internationally. Claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright or trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties, including our users. In addition, we are and have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we have generated or third-party content that we have made available within our services violates U.S. and non-U.S. law.\nWe also arrange for the distribution of third-party advertisements to third-party publishers and advertising networks, and we offer third-party products, services, or content. We may be subject to claims concerning these products, services, or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting, or providing access to them, even if we do not ourselves host, operate, provide, or provide access to these products, services, or content. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other\nresources, may result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services.\nFrom time to time, concerns have been expressed about whether our products, services, or processes compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, as nearly all of our products and services are web-based, the amount of data we store for our users on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users' data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We expect to continue to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based products and services we offer, and operate in more countries.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results and prospects.\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management. For instance, the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from the software used in the product. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products does not meet our customers' expectations or our products are found to be defective, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products, and we have third-party arrangements for the design of some components and parts. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.\nIn the past, Motorola, like many electronics manufacturers, has experienced supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural disasters and significant changes in the financial or business condition of its suppliers. Workaround plans to address shortages have entailed in the past, and could entail in the future, increased freight costs for expedited shipments. We cannot assure you that we will not experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future or that they will not negatively impact our operations. In addition, some of the components we use in our products are available only from a single source or limited sources, and we cannot assure you that we would be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain disruption.\nAdditionally, because many of our supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our hardware products more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results. Further, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supply.\nWe also require our suppliers and business partners to comply with law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them\nor their practices. If any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical, we could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations of or damage to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. If any of them fails to procure necessary license rights to third-party intellectual property, legal action could ensue that could impact the salability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third parties.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries (DRC) and procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such “conflict” minerals. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply DRC “conflict free” components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain DRC conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the \"conflict\" minerals used in our products.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of users' and customers' proprietary information, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis, and as a result, unauthorized parties have obtained, and may in the future obtain, access to our data or our users' or customers' data. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users' or customers' data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers.\nWeb spam and content farms could decrease our search quality, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\n“Web spam” refers to websites that attempt to violate a search engine's quality guidelines or that otherwise seek to rank higher in search results than a search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them. Although English-language web spam in our search results has been significantly reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek ways to improve their rankings inappropriately. We continuously combat web spam, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We face challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including “content farms”, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes focused on low-quality websites. If web spam and content farms continue to increase on Google, this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce user traffic to our websites. In addition, as we continue to take actions to improve our search quality and reduce low-quality content, this may in the short run reduce our AdSense revenues, since some of these websites are AdSense partners.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of certain of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and\nour disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using without adequate notice for financial reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities in our products and services, or damage to or failure of our systems, could result in interruptions in our services, which could reduce our revenues and profits, and damage our brand.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to further expand internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 55% of our consolidated revenues in 2013, and more than half of our user traffic has been coming from outside the U.S. In certain international markets, we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed.\nMost of our Motorola products are manufactured outside the U.S., primarily in China, Taiwan and Brazil. If our manufacturing in these countries is disrupted, our overall capacity could be reduced and sales or profitability could be negatively impacted. We require suppliers and business partners to comply with the law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. If any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical, we could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations of or damage to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. If any of them fails to procure necessary license rights to third-party intellectual property, legal action could ensue that could impact the salability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third parties.\nMoreover, in connection with Motorola Mobile's operations in Brazil, we have had and continue to have legal disputes and controversies, including tax, labor and trade compliance controversies and other legal matters that take many years to resolve. We incur legal and other costs in managing and defending these matters and expect to continue to incur such costs. Based on our assessment of these matters, we have recorded reserves on only a small portion of the total potential exposure. It is, however, very difficult to predict the outcome of legal disputes and controversies, including litigation, in Brazil and our ultimate exposure may be greater than our current assessments and related reserves.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:\n•\nChanges in local political, economic, social, and labor conditions, which may adversely harm our business.\n•\nRestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.\n•\nImport and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, and customs classifications that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market and may increase our operating costs.\n•\nPotential injunctions from importation into the U.S. of our Motorola products manufactured outside the U.S. in an ITC matter.\n•\nLonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.\n•\nStill developing foreign laws and legal systems.\n•\nUncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent.\n•\nDifferent employee/employer relationships, existence of workers' councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\nIn addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and antitrust and competition regulations, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties,\ncriminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nFinally, since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net income. Additionally, hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date, and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this section in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results:\n•\nOur ability to continue to attract users to our websites and satisfy existing users on our websites.\n•\nOur ability to monetize (or generate revenues from) traffic on our websites and our Google Network Members' websites.\n•\nRevenue fluctuations caused by changes in property mix, platform mix and geographical mix.\n•\nThe amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and our ability to manage the resulting risk through our foreign exchange risk management program.\n•\nThe amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure.\n•\nOur focus on long-term goals over short-term results.\n•\nThe results of our investments in risky projects, including new businesses, products, services, technologies and acquisitions.\n•\nOur ability to keep our websites operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions.\n•\nOur ability to generate significant revenues from services in which we have invested considerable time and resources.\nBecause our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results. In addition, advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. Also, user traffic tends to be seasonal. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.\nIf we were to lose the services of Larry, Sergey, Eric, or other key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In particular, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are critical to the overall management of Google and the development of our technology. Along with our Executive Chairman Eric E. Schmidt, they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success\ndepends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take measures, including legal actions, that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. Such interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth.\nNew technologies could block our ads, which would harm our business.\nTechnologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of our advertising products. Most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages for our users. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investment portfolio.\nGiven the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally. Credit ratings and pricing of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of gains on our foreign exchange risk management program, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Stock\nThe trading price for our Class A common stock may continue to be volatile, and if the shares of the new class of non-voting Class C capital stock are distributed as expected, the trading price of that class may also be volatile and may affect the trading price for the Class A common stock.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example, from January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013, the closing price of our Class A common stock ranged from $702.87 per share to $1,120.71 per share. The trading price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n•\nQuarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors.\n•\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments.\n•\nRecommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.\n•\nAnnouncements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance on earnings.\n•\nAnnouncements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.\n•\nCommentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other matters affecting our business and results, regardless of its accuracy.\n•\nThe volume of shares of Class A common stock available for public sale.\n•\nSales of Class A common stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by our directors, executive officers, and other employees).\n•\nShort sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, following the settlement of litigation involving the authorization to distribute our non-voting Class C capital stock, our board of directors has approved a distribution of shares of Class C capital stock as a dividend to our holders of Class A and Class B common stock. We expect that the market price for the shares of Class A common stock will generally reflect the effect of a two-for-one stock split once the dividend is distributed. Although we plan to list the Class C capital stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market, we cannot predict whether, or to what extent, a liquid trading market will develop for the Class C capital stock. If it does not or if the Class C capital stock is not attractive to targets as an acquisition currency or to our employees as an incentive, we may not achieve our objectives in creating this new class. As in the case of the Class A common stock, the trading price for the Class C capital stock may also be volatile and affected by the factors noted above, as well as by the difference in voting rights as between the Class A common stock and the Class C capital stock, the volume of Class C capital stock available for public sale and sales by us and our stockholders of Class C capital stock, including by institutional investors that may be unwilling, unable or choose not to hold non-voting shares they receive as part of the stock dividend. Whether or not the Class C capital stock is included in stock indices in the future may also affect the trading prices of the Class A common stock and the Class C capital stock.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital Stock regardless of our actual operating performance.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2013, Larry, Sergey, and Eric beneficially owned approximately 92.2% of our outstanding Class B common stock, representing approximately 61.7% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Larry, Sergey, and Eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C capital stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C capital stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could prolong the duration of Larry and Sergey's current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Together with Eric, they would also continue to be able to control any required stockholder vote with respect to certain change in control transactions involving Google (including an acquisition of Google by another company).\nThis concentrated control limits or severely restricts our stockholders' ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock could be adversely affected.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry, Sergey, and Eric have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. As noted above, the issuance of the Class C capital stock could have the effect of prolonging the influence of Larry, Sergey, and Eric.\n•\nOur board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the Board of Directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.\n•\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting.\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n•\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders' meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n•\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the Board of Directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.",
         "ITEM 1B.\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nOn April 11, 2013, we received a comment letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) related to various issues with respect to our public filings, including discussions of advertising and Motorola revenues in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We responded to the SEC on May 10, 2013. On June 27, 2013, November 13, 2013 and January 16, 2014, we received additional comment letters from the SEC on these and other matters.

The following table sets forth for the indicated periods the high and low sales prices per share for our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.\nOur Class B common stock is neither listed nor traded.\nHolders of Record\nAs of December 31, 2013, there were approximately, 2,536 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock, and the closing price of our Class A common stock was $1,120.71 per share as reported by the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by these record holders. As of December 31, 2013, there were approximately 74 stockholders of record of our Class B common stock.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividend on our common stock.

         "ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nGoogle is a global technology leader focused on improving the ways people connect with information. We aspire to build products and provide services that improve the lives of billions of people globally. Our mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful. Our innovations in web search and advertising have made our website a top internet property and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Our Google segment generates revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising. Businesses use our AdWords program and AdSense program to promote their products and services with advertising on both Google-owned properties and publishers' sites across the web.\nOur Motorola Mobile segment is focused on mobile wireless devices and related products and services and generates revenues primarily by selling hardware products. In January 2014, we entered into an agreement with Lenovo providing for the disposition of the Motorola Mobile segment. The transaction is expected to close in 2014.\nThe Motorola Home segment was focused on technologies and devices that provide video entertainment services to consumers by enabling subscribers to access a variety of interactive digital television services. In December 2012, we entered into an agreement for the disposition of the Motorola Home segment. The transaction closed on April 17, 2013. All financial results related to Motorola Home were presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nTrends in Our Businesses\nAdvertising transactions continue to shift from offline to online as the digital economy evolves. This has contributed to the rapid growth of our business since inception, resulting in substantially increased revenues, and we expect that our business will continue to grow. However, our revenue growth rate has generally declined over time, and it could do so in the future as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, our investments in new business strategies, products, services, and technologies, changes in our product mix, shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues, query growth rates and how users make queries, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, and the evolution of the online advertising market, including the increasing variety of online platforms for advertising, and other markets in which we participate.\nOur users are increasingly connected to the internet and using multiple devices to access our products and services, a trend that has increased our global search queries and changed our platform mix. We expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving consumer preferences, as well as by advertising trends, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices, and our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers in this multi-screen environment.\nThe main focus of our advertising programs is to help businesses reach people in the moments that matter across all devices with smarter ads that are relevant to their intent and context, reflecting our commitment to constantly improve their overall web experience. As a result, we expect to continue to take steps to improve the relevance of the ads displayed on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites. These steps include not displaying ads that generate low click-through rates or that send users to irrelevant or otherwise low-quality websites, updating our advertising policies and ensuring their compliance, and terminating our relationships with those Google Network Members whose websites do not meet our quality requirements. We may also continue to take steps to reduce the number of accidental clicks by our users. These steps could negatively affect the growth rate of our revenues.\nBoth seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenues, as well as aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click growth rates.\nThe operating margin we realize on revenues generated from ads placed on our Google Network Members’ websites through our AdSense program is significantly lower than the operating margin we realize from revenues generated from ads placed on our websites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on Google Network Members’ websites are shared with our Google Network Members. For the past five years, growth in advertising\nrevenues from our websites has generally exceeded that from our Google Network Members’ websites. This trend has had a positive impact on our operating margins, and we expect that this will continue for the foreseeable future, although the relative rate of growth in revenues from our websites compared to the rate of growth in revenues from our Google Network Members’ websites may vary over time. Also, the margins on advertising revenues from mobile phones and other newer advertising formats are generally lower than those from desktop computers and tablets. We expect this trend to continue to pressure our margins, particularly if we fail to realize the opportunities we anticipate with the transition to a dynamic multi-screen environment.\nWe conduct our Motorola Mobile business in highly competitive markets, facing both new and established competitors. The markets for many of our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, frequent new product introductions, changing consumer trends, short product life cycles, consumer loyalty and evolving industry standards. Market disruptions caused by new technologies, the entry of new competitors, consolidations among our customers and competitors, changes in regulatory requirements, changes in economic conditions, supply chain interruptions or other factors, can introduce volatility into our businesses. Meeting all of these challenges requires consistent operational planning and execution and investment in technology, resulting in innovative products that meet the needs of our customers around the world.\nFrom an overall business perspective, we continue to invest aggressively in areas of strategic focus, our systems, data centers, corporate facilities, information technology infrastructure, and employees. We expect to continue to hire aggressively for 2014 and provide competitive compensation programs to our employees. Our full-time employee headcount was 53,861 (including 11,113 headcount from Motorola Mobile and 5,204 from Motorola Home) at December 31, 2012, and 47,756 (including 3,894 headcount from Motorola Mobile) at December 31, 2013. Acquisitions will also remain an important component of our strategy and use of capital. We expect our cost of revenues will increase in dollars and may increase as a percentage of revenues in future periods, primarily as a result of forecasted increases in traffic acquisition costs, manufacturing and inventory-related costs, data center costs, content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees, and other costs. In particular, traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may increase in the future if we are unable to continue to improve the monetization or generation of revenues from traffic on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites.\nAs we expand our advertising programs and other products to international markets, we continue to increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency to U.S. dollar exchange rates. We have a foreign exchange risk management program that is designed to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. However, this program will not fully offset the effect of fluctuations on our revenues and earnings.\nOther revenues consist of non-advertising revenues including licensing, hardware and digital content. We expect other revenues to continue to grow. However, operating margin on other revenues is generally lower than that on advertising revenues.\nResults of Operations\nWe completed our acquisition of Motorola on May 22, 2012 (the acquisition date). In December 2012, we entered into an agreement for the disposition of the Motorola Home segment, and consequently, financial results related to Motorola Home were presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income in all periods presented. In April 2013, we completed the disposition of the Motorola Home segment.\nIn January 2014, we entered into an agreement with Lenovo providing for the disposition of the Motorola Mobile segment. The transaction is expected to close in 2014. As we evaluate the impact of this agreement, we expect financial results of Motorola Mobile will be presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income and assets and liabilities of Motorola Mobile to be disposed of will be presented as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets beginning in the first quarter of 2014.\nSubsequent to the acquisition of Motorola, we initiated a restructuring plan of our Motorola business. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of this restructuring plan and the associated restructuring charges.\nThe following table presents our historical operating results as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated:\nRevenues by Segment\nThe following table presents our segment revenues, by revenue source, for the periods presented (in millions):\nGoogle segment\nThe following table presents our Google segment revenues, by revenue source, as a percentage of total Google segment revenues for the periods presented:\nOur Google segment revenues increased $9,511 million from 2012 to 2013. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google websites and an increase in other revenues, and to a lesser extent, an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google Network Members' websites. The increase in other revenues was mainly driven by higher sales related to digital content and hardware products. The increase in advertising revenues for Google websites and Google Network Members' websites resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs, as paid clicks on Google websites and Google Network Members' websites increased approximately 25% from 2012 to 2013. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to certain monetization improvements including new and richer ad formats, an increase in aggregate traffic across all platforms, the continued global expansion of our products, advertisers, and user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network Members, partially offset by certain advertising policy changes. The impact from the increase in paid clicks on our revenue growth was partially offset by a decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. Average cost-per-click on Google websites and Google Network Members' websites decreased approximately 8% from 2012 to 2013. The decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was driven by various factors, such as the introduction of new products as well as changes in property mix, platform mix and geographical mix, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\nOur Google segment revenues increased $8,134 million from 2011 to 2012. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites and, to a lesser extent, an increase in other revenues driven by hardware product sales. The increase in advertising revenues for Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs, as aggregate paid clicks on Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites increased approximately 34% from 2011 to 2012. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to an increase in aggregate traffic across all platforms, certain monetization improvements including new ad formats, the continued global expansion of our products, advertisers, and user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network Members. The impact of this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. Average cost-per-click on Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites decreased approximately 12% from 2011 to 2012. The decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was driven by various factors, such as introduction of new products as well as changes in property mix, platform mix and geographical mix, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\nThe rate of change in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click, and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors, including the revenue growth rates on our websites compared to those of our Google Network Members, advertiser competition for keywords, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, seasonality, the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs, changes in advertising quality or formats, and general economic conditions. In addition, traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels also contributes to these fluctuations. Changes in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click may not be indicative of our performance or advertiser experiences in any specific geographic market, vertical, or industry.\nImprovements in our ability to monetize increased traffic primarily relate to enhancing the end user experience, including providing end users with ads that are more relevant to their search queries or to the content on the Google Network Members’ websites they visit. For instance, these improvements include displaying advertiser-nominated images that are relevant to the user query and creating a more engaging user shopping experience by enhancing\nsearch ads to include richer product information, such as product image, price, and merchant name. We believe that the increase in the number of paid clicks on Google websites and Google Network Members’ websites is substantially the result of our commitment to improving the relevance and quality of both our search results and the advertisements displayed, which we believe results in a better user experience, which in turn results in more searches, advertisers, Google Network Members and other partners.\nOther revenues in our Google segment increased $2,619 million from 2012 to 2013 and also increased as a percentage of the segment revenues. The increase was primarily due to growth of our digital content products, such as apps, music and movies. Additionally, we experienced an increase in our hardware revenues due to Chromecast, directly-sold Nexus products and Chrome OS devices. In 2011, other revenue was not a significant driver of overall Google segment revenues.\nMotorola Mobile segment\nOur Motorola Mobile segment revenues increased $307 million from 2012 to 2013. The increase was due to approximately seven months of results being included in 2012 while twelve months of results were included in 2013 and a 14% increase in average selling price (“ASP”) related to new product launches and changes in product mix during the year, partially offset by a 6% decrease in units shipped during 2013. We note that results between 2012 and 2013 are not comparable due to the significant restructuring efforts to simplify the product portfolio completed over the nineteen-month period.\nThe increase in the Motorola Mobile segment revenues from 2011 to 2012 resulted from the inclusion of revenues from the Motorola Mobile segment of $4,136 million subsequent to the acquisition in May 2012.\nElimination and other\nBeginning in the third quarter of 2013, Google and Motorola Mobile segment revenues have been impacted by intersegment transactions that are eliminated in consolidation. Additionally, segment revenues associated with certain products were recognized during the year in our segment results, but deferred to future periods in our consolidated financial statements. This presentation is consistent with what is provided to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to each segment and assessing their performance.\nRevenues by Geography\nThe following table presents our Google segment domestic and international revenues as a percentage of Google segment revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our customers for our Google segment:\nThe following table presents our consolidated domestic and international revenues as a percentage of consolidated revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our customers for our Google segment, and ship-to addresses of our customers for our Motorola Mobile segment:\nThe growth in revenues from the rest of the world as a percentage of the Google segment and consolidated revenues from 2012 to 2013 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs, and our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products for the international markets as well as increased revenues from the rest of the world in our Motorola Mobile segment in 2013 as compared to 2012.\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenues\nThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Japanese yen and Brazilian real) from 2012 to 2013 had an unfavorable impact on our international revenues, which was partially offset by the general weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies (primarily the Euro). Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our revenues from the United Kingdom would have been $67 million or 1.2% higher and our revenues from the rest of the world would have been approximately $613 million or 2.2% higher in 2013. This is before consideration of hedging gains of $63 million and $32 million recognized to revenues from the United Kingdom and the rest of the world in 2013.\nThe general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies (primarily the Euro) from 2011 to 2012 had an unfavorable impact on our international revenues. Had foreign exchange rates remained constant in these periods, our revenues from the United Kingdom would have been $68 million or 1.4% higher and our revenues from the rest of the world would have been approximately $1,211 million or 5.6% higher in 2012. This is before consideration of hedging gains of $18 million and $199 million recognized to revenues from the United Kingdom and the rest of the world in 2012.\nAlthough we expect to continue to make investments in international markets, these investments may not result in an increase in our international revenues as a percentage of total revenues in 2014 or thereafter. See Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about geographic areas.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts paid to our Google Network Members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search queries to our website (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share and fixed fee arrangements with our Google Network Members and distribution partners.\nCertain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not exclusively - or at all - based on revenue share. These fees are non-refundable. Further, these arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. We recognize fees under these arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are one year or longer, or based on any contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenues.\nCost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs; hardware inventory costs; credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; and content acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our websites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers. We also license content on the pages of our websites from which the content is sold and share most of the fees these sales generate with content providers. To the extent we are obligated to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments to our content providers, we recognize as content acquisition costs the contractual revenue share amount or the amount determined on a straight-line basis, whichever is greater, over the term of the agreements.\nIn addition, cost of revenues includes manufacturing and inventory-related costs primarily from our Motorola Mobile segment.\nThe following tables present our cost of revenues by operating segment, our traffic acquisition costs, and traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues in the Google segment, for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nGoogle segment\nCost of revenues for the Google segment increased $4,708 million from 2012 to 2013. The increase was due to increases in traffic acquisition costs of $1,302 million resulting from more distribution fees paid, more fees paid for additional traffic directed to our websites, as well as more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program. The remaining increase was primarily driven by an increase in data center costs, hardware inventory costs as a result of increased hardware sales, content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to YouTube and digital content, and revenue share payments to mobile carriers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily as a result of a shift of mix between Google website revenue and Google Network Members' websites.\nCost of revenues for the Google segment increased $3,877 million from 2011 to 2012. The increase was primarily related to an increase in traffic acquisition costs of $2,145 million resulting from more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program, more traffic directed to our websites, as well as more distribution fees paid. The remaining increase was primarily driven by increases in data center costs, hardware inventory costs and content acquisition costs. The increase in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily the result of a greater increase in traffic acquisition costs related to distribution arrangements compared to the increase in advertising revenues generated by Google websites.\nMotorola Mobile segment\nCost of revenues for the Motorola Mobile segment were not comparable between 2012 and 2013 because approximately seven months of results were included in 2012 while twelve months of results were included in 2013. Additionally, we conducted various restructuring activities to simplify the Motorola Mobile product portfolio subsequent to the acquisition in May 2012.\nUnallocated Items\nUnallocated items, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as restructuring and related charges, are not allocated to each segment because we do not include this information in our measurement of the performance of our operating segments.\nWe expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of total revenues in 2014 and in future periods, primarily as a result of increases in traffic acquisition costs, data center costs, hardware and inventory costs, manufacturing and inventory-related costs, content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees, and other costs. Traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues may fluctuate in the future based on a number of factors, including the following:\n•\nThe relative growth rates of revenues from our websites and from our Google Network Members’ websites.\n•\nWhether we are able to enter into more AdSense arrangements that provide for lower revenue share obligations or whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential Google Network Members results in less favorable revenue share arrangements.\n•\nWhether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites.\n•\nThe relative growth rates of expenses associated with distribution arrangements and the related revenues generated, including whether we share with certain existing and new distribution partners proportionately more of the aggregate advertising fees that we earn from paid clicks derived from search queries these partners direct to our websites.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents our research and development expenses by operating segment for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel responsible for the research and development activities relating to new and existing products and services, as well as depreciation and equipment-related costs. We expense research and development costs as incurred.\nGoogle segment\nResearch and development expenses for the Google segment increased $687 million from 2012 to 2013 and as a percentage of Google segment revenues remained relatively flat from 2012 to 2013. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $596 million, largely as a result of an 18% increase in research and development headcount.\nResearch and development expenses for the Google segment increased $708 million from 2011 to 2012 and as a percentage of Google segment revenues remained relatively flat from 2011 to 2012. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $359 million, largely as a result of a 15% increase in research and development headcount, an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $147 million, and an increase in professional services expense of $66 million.\nMotorola Mobile segment\nResearch and development expenses for the Motorola Mobile segment were not comparable between 2012 and 2013 because approximately seven months of results were included in 2012 while twelve months of results were included in 2013. Additionally, we conducted various restructuring activities to simplify the Motorola Mobile product portfolio subsequent to the acquisition in May 2012.\nUnallocated Items\nUnallocated items, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as restructuring and related charges, are not allocated to each segment because we do not include this information in our measurement of the performance of our operating segments.\nWe expect that research and development expenses will increase in dollar amount in 2014 and future periods because we expect to continue to invest in building the necessary employee and system infrastructure required to support the development of new, and to improve existing, products and services.\nSales and Marketing\nThe following table presents our sales and marketing expenses by operating segment for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel engaged in customer service, sales, and sales support functions, as well as advertising and promotional expenditures.\nGoogle segment\nSales and marketing expenses for the Google segment increased $985 million from 2012 to 2013 and as a percentage of Google segment revenues remained flat from 2012 to 2013. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $674 million, as well as an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $233 million, largely as a result of a 13% increase in sales and marketing headcount.\nSales and marketing expenses for the Google segment increased $789 million from 2011 to 2012 and as a percentage of Google segment revenues remained flat from 2011 to 2012. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $390 million, largely as a result of a 14% increase in sales and marketing headcount, as well as an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $288 million.\nMotorola Mobile segment\nSales and marketing expenses for the Motorola Mobile segment were not comparable between 2012 and 2013 because approximately seven months of results were included in 2012 while twelve months of results were included in 2013. Additionally, we conducted various restructuring activities to simplify the Motorola Mobile product portfolio subsequent to the acquisition in May 2012.\nElimination and Unallocated Items\nElimination items represent intersegment transactions that are eliminated in consolidation. Unallocated items, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as restructuring and related charges, are not allocated to each segment because we do not include this information in our measurement of the performance of our operating segments.\nWe expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of total revenues in 2014 and future periods, as we expand our business globally, increase advertising and promotional expenditures in connection with new and existing products, and increase the level of service we provide to our advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe following table presents our general and administrative expenses by operating segment for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel and facilities, and include costs related to our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology and legal organizations, as well as fees for professional services. Professional services are principally comprised of outside legal, audit, information technology consulting, and outsourcing services. General and administrative expenses also include amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets.\nGoogle segment\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the Google segment increased $877 million from 2012 to 2013 and as a percentage of Google segment revenues remained relatively flat from 2012 to 2013. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $396 million, largely as a result of a 15% increase in general and administrative headcount, an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expense of $222 million, as well as an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets of $157 million.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the Google segment increased $669 million from 2011 to 2012 and as a percentage of Google segment revenues remained relatively flat from 2011 to 2012. This increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets of $274 million, an increase in professional services expense of $147 million, the majority of which was related to legal costs, and an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $122 million, primarily as a result of an 11% increase in general and administrative headcount.\nMotorola Mobile segment\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the Motorola Mobile segment were not comparable between 2012 and 2013 because approximately seven months of results were included in 2012 while twelve months of results were included in 2013. Additionally, we conducted various restructuring activities to simplify the Motorola Mobile product portfolio subsequent to the acquisition in May 2012.\nUnallocated Items\nUnallocated items, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as restructuring and related charges, are not allocated to each segment because we do not include this information in our measurement of the performance of our operating segments.\nAs we expand our business and incur additional expenses, we expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of total revenues in 2014 and in future periods.\nCharge Related to the Resolution of Department of Justice Investigation\nIn connection with a resolution of an investigation by the United States Department of Justice into the use of Google advertising by certain advertisers, we accrued $500 million during the first quarter of 2011, which was paid in August 2011 upon final resolution of that matter.\nRestructuring and related charges\nThe following table presents our restructuring and related charges for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\n(1) These amounts are included in the previously discussed sections above, as unallocated items related to cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses.\nRestructuring and related charges decreased $450 million from 2012 to 2013 because we completed the majority of our restructuring and related activities related to Motorola in 2012.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table presents our stock-based compensation for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\n(1) These amounts are included in the previously discussed sections above, as unallocated items related to cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses.\n(2) Stock-based compensation expenses of $126 million and $21 million are included in \"restructuring and related charges\" above for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013.\nStock-based compensation increased $724 million from 2012 to 2013 and as a percentage of consolidated revenues remained flat from 2012 to 2013. This increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in headcount to support our growing business.\nStock-based compensation increased $549 million from 2011 to 2012 and as a percentage of consolidated revenues remained flat from 2011 to 2012. This increase in expenses was primarily due to additional stock awards issued to existing and new employees, as well as awards issued in connection with the acquisition of Motorola.\nStock-based compensation expense for the Motorola Home segment was included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations.\nWe estimate stock-based compensation related to awards granted through December 31, 2013 to be approximately $3.1 billion in 2014 and $3.2 billion thereafter. This estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to employee stock awards that are granted after December 31, 2013 or non-employee stock awards that have been or may be granted. In addition, to the extent forfeiture rates are different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nInterest and Other Income, Net\nInterest and other income, net, decreased $96 million from 2012 to 2013. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the gain on divestiture of businesses (other than Motorola Home) of $245 million and a decrease in the realized gain on investments of $81 million, partially offset by a decrease in foreign currency exchange loss of $152 million and an increase in interest income of $72 million.\nInterest and other income, net, increased $42 million from 2011 to 2012. This increase was primarily driven by a gain on divestiture of business of $188 million in 2012, an impairment charge related to equity investments of $110 million in 2011, partially offset by an increase in foreign currency exchange loss of $152 million and a decrease in interest income of $99 million.\nThe costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities that we recognized to interest and other income, net, are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts, as well as the volatility of the foreign exchange rates.\nAs we expand our international business, we believe costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program may increase in dollar amount in 2014 and future periods.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for income taxes, and effective tax rate for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nThe federal research and development credit expired on December 31, 2011. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law. Under this act, the federal research and development credit was retroactively extended for amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2011 and before January 1, 2014. The effects of these changes in the tax law have resulted in a tax benefit which was recognized in the first quarter of 2013, the quarter in which the law was enacted.\nOur provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate decreased from 2012 to 2013, primarily as a result of proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates as well as the federal research and development credit related to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\nOur provision for income taxes increased from 2011 to 2012, primarily as a result of increases in federal income taxes, driven by higher taxable income year over year and expiration of the federal research and development credit, partially offset by proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate decreased from 2011 to 2012, primarily as a result of proportionately more earnings realized in countries that\nhave lower statutory tax rates as well as a discrete item related to an investigation by the Department of Justice recognized in 2011, which was not deductible for income tax purposes.\nOur effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates. Our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities, including European governments. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional information about our provision for income taxes.\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNet Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations\nOn April 17, 2013, we completed the disposition of the Motorola Home segment to Arris and certain other persons for consideration of approximately $2,412 million in cash, including cash of $2,238 million received on the closing date and certain post-closing adjustments of $174 million received in the third quarter of 2013, and approximately $175 million in Arris' common stock (10.6 million shares). Subsequent to the transaction, we own approximately 7.8% of the outstanding shares of Arris. Additionally, in connection with the disposition, we agreed to indemnify Arris for potential liability from certain intellectual property infringement litigation, for which we recorded an indemnification liability of $175 million, the majority of which was settled during 2013.\nThe disposition resulted in a net gain of $757 million, which was presented as part of net income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe Motorola Home segment results have been presented as a discontinued operation for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013. The following table provides the financial results included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations during the periods presented (in millions):\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year. Please note that previously reported quarters have been adjusted to show discontinued operations for the disposition of the Motorola Home business.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2013. This table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically\nincrease significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2013:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2013, we had $58.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the U.S., corporate securities, mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities.\nAs of December 31, 2013, $33.6 billion of the $58.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds are needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. At December 31, 2013, we had unused letters of credit for approximately $173 million. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. In addition, we may make acquisitions or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund any such acquisitions and licensing activities. Additional financing may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us.\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2013, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.1% that mature at various dates through June 2014. Average commercial paper borrowings during the year were $2.1 billion and the maximum amount outstanding during the year was $2.5 billion. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility and no amounts were outstanding.\nIn May 2011, we issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three equal tranches, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021, with stated interest rates of 1.25%, 2.125%, and 3.625%. The net proceeds from the sale of the notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. In May 2013, we reclassified the first tranche of $1.0 billion unsecured senior notes due in May 2014 as short-term debt. We plan to issue $1.0 billion of long-term debt when this note matures in 2014. As of December 31, 2013, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of these notes were $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion. The estimated fair value was based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of December 31, 2013. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the notes.\nIn August 2013, we entered into a $258 million capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028 with an option to purchase in 2016. The effective rate of the capital lease obligation approximates the market rate. The estimated fair value of the capital lease obligation approximated its carrying value at December 31, 2013.\nIn summary, our cash flows are as follows (in millions):\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by operating cash flows is advertising revenues generated by Google websites and Google Network Members' websites. We also generate cash from the sale of our hardware products, primarily in the Motorola Mobile segment. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities include payments to our Google Network Members and distribution partners, which are based on the revenue share or fixed fee arrangements, as well as payments for manufacturing and inventory-related costs primarily for the Motorola Mobile segment. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, other general corporate expenditures and income taxes.\nCash provided by operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including stock-based compensation expense, depreciation, amortization, deferred income taxes, excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities, as well as the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2012 to 2013, primarily due to increased net income adjusted for gain on divestiture of businesses, depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense, and amortization of intangible assets. These increases were partially offset by the net decrease in cash from changes in working capital primarily as a result of a decrease in income taxes, an increase in accounts receivable and inventories, offset by an increase in accounts payable.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2011 to 2012, primarily due to increased net income adjusted for gain on divestiture of businesses, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets. In addition, there was a net increase in cash from changes in working capital primarily driven by an increase in income taxes and a decrease in accounts receivable and inventories. These increases were partially offset by the net increase in prepaid and other assets and a decrease in accounts payable.\nAs we expand our business internationally, we have offered payment terms to certain advertisers that are standard in their locales but longer than terms we would generally offer to our domestic advertisers. This may increase our working capital requirements and may have a negative effect on cash provided by our operating activities.\nCash Used In Investing Activities\nCash provided by or used in investing activities primarily consist of purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities, acquisitions of businesses and intangible assets, divestiture of businesses, and purchases of property and equipment. In addition, cash provided by or used in investing activities include our investments in reverse repurchase agreements and the cash collateral received or returned from our securities lending program.\nCash used in investing activities increased from 2012 to 2013, primarily attributable to a net increase in purchases of marketable securities and an increase in capital expenditures primarily related to our production equipment, data centers, and real estate purchases. This increase was partially offset by lower spend related to acquisitions and an increase in proceeds received from divestiture of businesses.\nCash used in investing activities decreased from 2011 to 2012, primarily attributable to a decrease in purchases of marketable securities, partially offset by a decrease in maturities and sales of marketable securities and an increase in spend related to acquisitions due to the purchase of Motorola in 2012.\nIn order to manage expected increases in internet traffic, advertising transactions, and new products and services, and to support our overall global business expansion, we expect to make significant investments in production equipment, our systems, data centers, corporate facilities, and information technology infrastructure in 2014 and thereafter. However, the amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate on a quarterly basis.\nIn addition, we expect to continue to spend cash on acquisitions and other investments. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product and service offerings.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nCash provided by or used in financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds or payments from issuance or repayments of short-term debt under our commercial paper program and net proceeds or payments and excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities.\nCash used in financing activities increased from 2012 to 2013, primarily driven by an increase in net cash payments related to debt and, to a lesser extent, an increase in net payments for stock-based award activities.\nCash provided by financing activities increased from 2011 to 2012, primarily driven by an increase in net cash proceeds received related to debt, partially offset by an increase in net payments for stock-based award activities.\nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2013\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring primarily between 2014 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the above table. Certain of these leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases have adjustments for market provisions.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations represent non-cancelable contractual obligations at December 31, 2013. These contracts are primarily related to certain of our distribution arrangements, video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, data center operations and facility build-outs, as well as purchase of inventory.\nLong-term Debt Obligations\nLong-term debt obligations represent principal and interest payments to be made over the life of our unsecured senior notes issued in May 2011 and our capital lease obligation incurred in August 2013. Please see Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities represent cash obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities and consist primarily of payments owed in connection with certain investments and asset retirement obligations.\nIn addition to the amounts above, we had long-term taxes payable of $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2013 related to tax positions for which the timing of the ultimate resolution is uncertain. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table.\nOff-Balance Sheet Entities\nAs of December 31, 2013, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP.) In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nAlthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income\ntaxes in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nOur effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, state taxes, certain benefits realized related to stock-based award activities, and research and development tax credits. The effective tax rates were 21.0%, 19.4%, and 15.7% for 2011, 2012, and 2013. Our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, indirect taxes, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and a range of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the range of the possible loss in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related ranges of possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology; and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nOther estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more fully discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. We evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and, if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill impairment tests require judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. As of December 31, 2013, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our marketable and non-marketable securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as interest and other income, net.",
         "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar. Our most significant currency exposures are the Euro, the British pound, and Japanese Yen. We are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency.\nWe use foreign exchange option contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. We designate these option contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The fair value of the option contract is separated into its intrinsic and time values. Changes in the time value are recorded in interest and other income, net. Changes in the intrinsic value are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20%, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately $9 million and $4 million lower at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest and other income, net, would have been approximately $140 million and $123 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20%, the amount recorded in accumulated AOCI related to our foreign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately $1.7 billion higher both at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest and other income, net, would have been approximately $159 million and $120 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013.\nIn addition, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in interest and other income, net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $9 million and $52 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. The adverse impact at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $731 million and $853 million from foreign exchange contracts in place for the months of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements. We invest primarily in U.S. government and its agency securities, money market and other funds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, municipal securities, time deposits, and asset backed securities. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, unrealized losses on our marketable debt securities were primarily due to temporary interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to the fixed interest rates on our debt securities. We account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with changes on gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold. We use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge realized gains and losses on our securities. These derivative contracts are accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Interest and other income, net.\nWe considered the historical volatility of short-term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable securities of approximately $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, after taking into consideration the offsetting effect from interest rate derivative contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis points) decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our forward-starting interest swaps of approximately $107 million and $92 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013.",

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2012 and 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated February 11, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 11, 2014\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Google Inc.\nWe have audited Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria). Google Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, Google Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2012 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 of Google Inc. and our report dated February 11, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 11, 2014\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except share and par value amounts which are reflected in thousands,\nand par value per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(In millions, except for share amounts which are reflected in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. Google Inc. and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nWe were incorporated in California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising in our Google segment. To a lesser extent, we generate revenues primarily from sales of mobile devices in our Motorola Mobile segment.\nIn April 2013, we completed the disposition of the Motorola Home segment to Arris Group, Inc. (Arris) and certain other persons. See Note 8 for further discussion of the disposition of the Motorola Home segment.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Google Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of stock-based awards, inventory valuations, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nIn the second quarter of 2013, we revised the estimated useful lives of certain types of property and equipment which resulted in an additional depreciation expense of $207 million during the year ended December 31, 2013.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table presents our revenues by revenue source (in millions):\nWe recognize revenues when the services or products have been provided or delivered, the fees we charge are fixed or determinable, we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nGoogle AdWords is our auction-based advertising program that enables advertisers to place text-based and display ads on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites. Display advertising comprises the videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across the web on computers and mobile devices, including smart phones and handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets. Most of our customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer advertising on a cost-per-impression basis that enables advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads display on our websites and our Google Network Members’ websites as specified by the advertisers.\nGoogle AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on our Google Network Members’ websites.\nWe recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results or content on our websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. For those advertisers using our cost-per-impression pricing, we recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on our websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. We report our Google AdSense revenues on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisers.\nFor hardware product sales, where we sell directly to end customers or through distribution channels, revenue recognition generally occurs when products have been shipped, risk of loss has transferred to the customer, objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met, no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts, price protection, returns and customer incentives can be reasonably and reliably estimated. Recorded revenues are reduced by these allowances. Where these allowances cannot be reasonably and reliably estimated, we recognize revenue at the time the product sells through the distribution channel to the end customer.\nFor the sale of certain third-party products and services, we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customers or the net amount earned as revenue share. Generally, when we are primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk or have latitude in establishing prices, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. We generally record the net amounts as revenue share earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have inventory risk or latitude in establishing prices. Such amounts earned are typically determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed fee, or a combination of the two.\nFor arrangements that include multiple deliverables, primarily for products that contain software essential to the hardware products’ functionality and services, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, we use a hierarchy to determine the selling prices to be used for allocating revenue: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price, and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable. ESPs reflect our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.\nWe record deferred revenues upon invoicing or when cash payments are received in advance of our performance in the underlying agreement on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs. Traffic acquisition costs consist of amounts ultimately paid to our Google Network Members under AdSense arrangements and to certain other partners (our distribution partners) who distribute our toolbar and other products (collectively referred to as access points) or otherwise direct search queries to our website (collectively referred to as distribution arrangements). These amounts are primarily based on the revenue share and fixed fee arrangements with our Google Network Members and distribution partners.\nCertain distribution arrangements require us to pay our partners based on a fee per access point delivered and not exclusively - or at all - based on revenue share. These fees are non-refundable. Further, these arrangements are terminable at will, although under the terms of certain contracts we or our distribution partners may be subject to penalties in the event of early termination. We recognize fees under these arrangements over the estimated useful lives of the access points (approximately two years) to the extent we can reasonably estimate those lives and they are longer than one year, or based on any contractual revenue share, if greater. Otherwise, the fees are charged to expense as incurred. The estimated useful life of the access points is based on the historical average period of time they generate traffic and revenues.\nCost of revenues also includes the expenses associated with the operation of our data centers, including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs, hardware inventory costs, credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, as well as content acquisition costs. We have entered into arrangements with certain content providers under which we distribute or license their video and other content. In a number of these arrangements, we display ads on the pages of our websites from which the content is viewed and share most of the fees these ads generate with the content providers. We also license content on the pages of our websites from which the content is sold and share most of the fees these sales generate with content providers. To the extent we are obligated to make guaranteed minimum revenue share payments\nto our content providers, we recognize as content acquisition costs the contractual revenue share amount or the amount determined on a straight-line basis, whichever is greater, over the terms of the agreements.\nIn addition, cost of revenues includes manufacturing and inventory-related costs primarily from our Motorola Mobile segment.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe have elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options on the dates of grant. Restricted stock units (RSUs) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. Shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of RSUs outstanding. Furthermore, we record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us as a reduction to additional paid-in capital when paid. Also, we recognize stock-based compensation using the straight-line method.\nWe include as part of cash flows from financing activities the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax-effected compensation of the related stock-based awards for options exercised and RSUs vested during the period. During the years ended December 31, 2011, December 31, 2012, and December 31, 2013, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $621 million, $736 million, and $1,174 million, and the total direct tax benefit realized, including the excess tax benefit, from stock-based award activities was $451 million, $747 million, and $1,195 million. We have elected to account for the indirect effects of stock-based awards - primarily the research and development tax credit - through the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2011, December 31, 2012, and December 31, 2013, we recognized stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefits of $1,974 million and $413 million, $2,649 million and $591 million, and $3,268 million and $720 million. Additionally, net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 includes stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefits of $43 million and $11 million, and $75 million and $24 million, respectively.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nOur revenues are primarily derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, our revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the world. Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, for our Motorola Mobile segment, the vast majority of our Motorola products (other than some prototypes) are manufactured outside the U.S., primarily in China and Brazil.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments and municipalities in the U.S., corporate securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. In 2011, 2012, and 2013, we generated approximately 46%, 47%, and 45% of our revenues from customers based in the U.S., with the majority of customers outside of the U.S. located in Europe and Japan. Many of our Google Network Members are in the internet industry. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend, but generally we do not require collateral from our customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations.\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2011, 2012, and 2013.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial assets and financial liabilities that include cash equivalents, marketable securities, and foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We measure certain other assets including our non-marketable equity securities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when\nthey are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Our other current financial assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying value and are therefore not recorded at fair value.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nWe invest our excess cash primarily in time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments and municipalities in the U.S., corporate securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities.\nWe classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities.\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as available-for-sale. We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other-than-temporary, which we record as interest and other income, net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of interest and other income, net.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe have accounted for non-marketable equity securities either under the equity or cost method. Investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee are accounted for under the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our marketable and non-marketable securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as interest and other income, net.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we do not charge interest. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers. We determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, computed using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. We depreciate buildings over periods up to 25 years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the\nremaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property (including land) and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. Depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed to external users, before technological feasibility of such products is reached. We have determined that technological feasibility was reached shortly before the release of those products and as a result, the development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before the release of those products were not material, and accordingly, were expensed as incurred. Software development costs also include costs to develop software programs to be used solely to meet our internal needs and cloud based applications used to deliver our services.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition. We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nLong-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review property and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. We have made no material adjustments to our long-lived assets in any of the years presented. In addition, we test our goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that this asset may be impaired. No goodwill impairment has been identified in any of the years presented.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one to twelve years.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize income taxes under the liability method. We recognize deferred income taxes for differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity. We recorded $107 million of net translation losses in 2011, $75 million of net translation gains in 2012, and $89 million of net translation gains in 2013. We record net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions as a component of foreign currency exchange losses in interest and other income, net. These gains and losses are net of those recognized on foreign exchange contracts. We recorded $38 million of net losses in 2011, $78 million of net losses in 2012, and $120 million of net losses in 2013.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $1,544 million, $2,332 million, and $2,848 million.\nNote 2. Net Income Per Share of Class A and Class B Common Stock\nWe compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options, warrants issued under the TSO program, and restricted stock units. The TSO program was discontinued as of November 29, 2013. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, warrants, and restricted stock units is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Further, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock (in this case the right of our Class A common stock to receive an equal dividend to any declared on our Class B common stock) must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):\nThe net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.\nNote 3. Financial Instruments\nFair Value Measurements\nWe measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, and foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2 because we use quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair value. We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment categories as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 (in millions):\n(1)\nMajority of our time deposits are foreign deposits.\n(2)\nThe balances at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 were related to cash collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months. See below for further discussion of this program.\nDuring the second quarter of 2013, we received approximately $175 million in Arris' common stock (10.6 million shares) in connection with the disposition of the Motorola Home segment (see details in Note 8). These shares are accounted for as available-for-sale marketable equity securities.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method. We recognized gross realized gains of $383 million and $460 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. We recognized gross realized losses of $101 million and $259 million for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. We reflect these gains and losses as a component of interest and other income, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable debt securities, accounted for as available-for-sale securities and classified by the contractual maturity date of the securities (in millions):\nThe following tables present gross unrealized losses and fair values for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):\nWe periodically review our marketable debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment. We consider factors such as the duration, severity and the reason for the decline in value, the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (i) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, and (ii) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, we did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment loss.\nNon-Marketable Equity Investments\nOur non-marketable equity investments are investments we have made in privately held companies accounted for under the equity or cost method. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, these investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $921 million and $975 million, respectively, and these investments accounted for under the cost method had a carrying value of $548 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. For investments accounted for under the cost method, we concluded that their fair values approximated their carrying values as of December 31, 2012 and exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2013. We periodically review our non-marketable equity investments for impairment. No material impairments or realized gains and losses were recognized on our non-marketable equity investments for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013.\nSecurities Lending Program\nFrom time to time, we enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income. We loan selected securities which are collateralized in the form of cash or securities. Cash collateral is invested in reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized in the form of securities.\nWe classify loaned securities as cash equivalents or marketable securities and record the cash collateral as an asset with a corresponding liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We classify reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months as cash equivalents and those longer than three months as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For security collateral received, we do not record an asset or liability except in the event of counterparty default.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as interest and other income, net, as part of revenues, or as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as discussed below.\nWe enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and our anticipated debt issuance. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $43 million and $35 million.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe use options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $9.5 billion and $10.0 billion as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 36 months or less.\nIn 2012, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps that effectively locked in an interest rate on our anticipated debt issuance of $1.0 billion in 2014. The total notional amount of these forward-starting interest swaps was $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 with terms calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate.\nWe initially report any gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify cumulative gains and losses to revenues or interest expense when the hedged transactions are recorded. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI would be immediately reclassified to interest and other income, net. Further, we exclude the change in the time value of the options from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We record the premium paid or time value of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter, we recognize changes to this time value in interest and other income, net.\nAs of December 31, 2013, the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was $93 million, of which $11 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in interest and other income, net, along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in the time value for forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The notional principal of these contracts was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of forward and option contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in interest and other income, net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts outstanding was $6.6 billion and $9.4 billion at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013.\nWe also use exchange-traded interest rate futures contracts and “To Be Announced” (TBA) forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to hedge interest rate risks on certain fixed income securities. The TBA\ncontracts meet the definition of derivative instruments in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. Our interest rate futures and TBA contracts (together interest rate contracts) are not designated as hedging instruments. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in interest and other income, net. The gains and losses are generally economically offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of AOCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from AOCI into interest and other income, net. The total notional amounts of interest rate contracts outstanding were $25 million and $13 million at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013.\nThe fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):\nThe effect of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships on income and other comprehensive income (OCI) is summarized below (in millions):\n(1)\nGains (losses) related to the ineffective portion of the hedges were not material in all periods presented.\nThe effect of derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationships on income is summarized below (in millions):\n(2)\nLosses related to the amount excluded from effectiveness testing of the hedges were $14 million, $8 million, and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013.\nThe effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on income is summarized below (in millions):\nOffsetting of Derivatives, Securities Lending and Reverse Repurchase Agreements\nWe present our derivatives, securities lending and reverse repurchase agreements at gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, our master netting and other similar arrangements allow net settlements under certain conditions. As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, information related to these offsetting arrangements was as follows (in millions):\n(1) The balances at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 were related to derivative liabilities which are allowed to be net settled against derivative assets in accordance with our master netting agreements.\n(2) The balances at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 included $929 million and $1,270 million recorded in cash and cash equivalents, respectively, and $700 million and $100 million recorded in receivable under reverse repurchase agreements, respectively.\n(3) The balances at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013 were related to derivative assets which are allowed to be net settled against derivative liabilities in accordance with our master netting agreements.\nNote 4. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, we had $2.5 billion and $2.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper recorded as short-term debt with weighted-average interest rates of 0.2% and 0.1%. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. At December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility, and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. The estimated fair value of the short-term debt approximated its carrying value at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013.\nOur short-term debt balance also includes the short-term portion of certain long-term debt, as described in the section below.\nLong-Term Debt\nIn May 2011, we issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three tranches (collectively, the Notes) and in August 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation. The details of these financing arrangements are described in the table below (in millions):\nThe effective interest yields of the 2014, 2016, and 2021 Notes were 1.258%, 2.241%, and 3.734%, respectively. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 19 and November 19 of each year. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole or from time to time in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes for general corporate purposes. The total estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. The fair value of the Notes was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nIn August 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028 with an option to purchase the property in 2016. The effective rate of the capital lease obligation approximates the market rate. The estimated fair value of the capital lease obligation approximated its carrying value at December 31, 2013.\nAt December 31, 2013, aggregate future principal payments for long-term debt (including short-term portion of long-term debt) and capital lease obligation were as follows (in millions):\nNote 5. Balance Sheet Components\nInventories\nInventories consisted of the following (in millions):\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following (in millions):\nProperty under capital lease with a cost basis of $258 million was included in construction in progress as of December 31, 2013.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe components of AOCI, net of tax, were as follows (in millions):\nThe effects on net income of amounts reclassified from AOCI for the year ended December 31, 2013 were as follows (in millions):\nNote 6. Acquisitions\n2013 Acquisitions\nIn June 2013, we completed our acquisition of Waze Limited (Waze), a provider of a mobile map application which provides turn-by-turn navigation and real-time traffic updates powered by incidents and route information submitted by a community of users, for a total cash consideration of $969 million. The acquisition is expected to enhance our customers' user experience by offering real time traffic information to meet users' daily navigation needs. Of the total purchase price, $841 million was attributed to goodwill and $193 million was attributed to intangible assets, offset by $65 million of other net liabilities assumed. The goodwill of $841 million is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for a total cash consideration of approximately $489 million, of which $268 million was attributed to intangible assets, $238 million to goodwill, and $17 million to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product offerings. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $38 million.\nPro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in aggregate.\nFor all acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2013, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 4.8 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 5.5 years, and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 3.5 years.\n2012 Acquisitions\nOn May 22, 2012, we completed our acquisition of Motorola, a provider of innovative technologies, products and services that enable a range of mobile and wireline digital communication, information and entertainment experiences. The acquisition is expected to protect and advance our Android ecosystem and enhance competition in mobile computing. Under the transaction, we acquired all outstanding common shares of Motorola for $40 per share and all vested Motorola stock options and restricted stock units, for a total purchase price of approximately $12.4 billion in cash. In addition, we assumed $401 million of unvested Motorola stock options and restricted stock units, which will be recorded as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining service periods. Transaction costs were approximately $50 million, which have been recorded as general and administrative expense as incurred.\nOf the $12.4 billion total purchase price, $2.9 billion was cash acquired, $5.5 billion was attributed to patents and developed technology, $2.5 billion to goodwill, $0.7 billion to customer relationships, and $0.8 billion to other net assets acquired.\nThe goodwill of $2.5 billion is primarily attributed to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2012, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for a total cash consideration of approximately $1,171 million, of which $733 million was attributed to goodwill, $462 million to acquired intangible assets, and $24 million to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product offerings. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $29 million.\n2011 Acquisitions\nIn April 2011, we completed the acquisition of ITA Software, Inc., a privately-held flight information software company, for $676 million in cash, of which $394 million was attributed to acquired intangible assets, $323 million to goodwill, and $41 million to net liabilities assumed.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2011, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for a total cash consideration of approximately $1.3 billion, of which $795 million was attributed to goodwill, $593 million to acquired intangible assets, and $86 million to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product offerings.\nNote 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2013 were as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2013, the amount of goodwill related to the Motorola Mobile segment was not material.\nInformation regarding our acquisition-related intangible assets is as follows (in millions):\nPatents and developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names and other have weighted-average useful lives from the date of purchase of 8.1 years, 6.5 years, and 5.3 years. Amortization expense of acquisition-related intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013 was $441 million, $884 million, and $1,158 million.\nAs of December 31, 2013, expected amortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter was as follows (in millions):\nNote 8. Discontinued Operations\nOn April 17, 2013, we completed the disposition of the Motorola Home segment to Arris and certain other persons for consideration of approximately $2,412 million in cash, including cash of $2,238 million received at the date of close and certain post-close adjustments of $174 million received in the third quarter of 2013, and approximately $175 million in Arris' common stock (10.6 million shares). Subsequent to the transaction, we own approximately 7.8% of the outstanding shares of Arris. Additionally, in connection with the disposition, we agreed to indemnify Arris for potential liability from certain intellectual property infringement litigation, for which we recorded an indemnification liability of $175 million, the majority of which was settled subsequent to the disposition.\nThe disposition resulted in a net gain of $757 million, which was presented as part of net income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe Motorola Home segment results have been presented as a discontinued operation for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013. The following table provides the financial results included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations during the periods presented (in millions):\nThe following table presents the aggregate carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities divested (in millions):\nNote 9. Restructuring charges\nSubsequent to our acquisition of Motorola in May 2012, we initiated a restructuring plan for Motorola, primarily in our Motorola Mobile segment, to reduce workforce, reorganize management structure, close or consolidate certain facilities, as well as simplify our mobile product portfolio. These changes were designed to return the Motorola Mobile segment to profitability. Pursuant to this restructuring plan, we have incurred cumulative charges of approximately $821 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013, changes to restructuring accruals were as follows (in millions):\n(1) Non-cash items were primarily related to restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, restructuring charges were included in costs and expenses as follows (in millions):\nNote 10. Interest and Other Income, Net\nThe components of interest and other income, net, were as follows (in millions):\n(1) Gain on divestiture of Home business was included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nNote 11. Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring primarily between 2014 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table below. Certain of these arrangements have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis.\nAs of December 31, 2013, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases, net of sublease income amounts, were as follows over each of the next five years and thereafter (in millions):\nCertain leases have adjustments for market provisions. Amounts in the above table represent our best estimates of future payments to be made under these leases. Rent expense under operating leases, including co-location arrangements, was $380 million, $448 million, and $525 million in 2011, 2012, and 2013.\nPurchase Obligations\nAt December 31, 2013, we had $3.3 billion of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, primarily related to certain of our distribution arrangements, video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, data center operations and facility build-outs, as well as purchase of inventory.\nLetters of Credit\nAt December 31, 2013, we had unused letters of credit for $173 million, of which $69 million related to our Motorola Mobile segment.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business to facilitate transactions in our services and products, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network Members, and lessors with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of December 31, 2013, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible.\nLegal Matters\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. We believe we have adequately responded to all of the allegations made against us. We continue to cooperate with the EC and are pursuing a potential resolution that would avoid a finding of infringement and a fine. The EC has also opened an investigation into Motorola's licensing practices for standards essential patents and use of standards-essential patents in litigation on the basis of complaints brought by Microsoft and Apple. The EC has issued a Statement of Objections against Motorola alleging abuse of a dominant position with respect to these standards-essential patents. We have responded to the Statement of Objections and are defending the case.\nThe Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia in Argentina, the Competition Commission of India, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission, Brazil's Council for Economic Defense and the Canadian Competition Bureau have also opened investigations into certain of our business practices.\nState attorneys general from the states of Texas, Ohio, and Mississippi have also issued Civil Investigative Demands relating to our business practices. We are cooperating with the state attorneys general and are responding to their information requests on an ongoing basis.\nEPA Investigation\nIn February 2009, we learned of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) investigation into an alleged release of refrigerant at one of our smaller data center facilities, which we acquired from DoubleClick, and the accuracy of related statements and records. We are cooperating with the EPA and have provided documents and other materials.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies, including Android, Google Search, Google AdWords, Google AdSense, Google Books, Google News, Google Image Search, Google Chrome, Google Talk, Google Voice, Motorola devices and YouTube, infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an ITC action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Since the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.\nOther\nWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust (such as the pending investigation by the EC described above), intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.\nCertain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.\nWith respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nTaxes\nWe are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various other tax authorities, including European governments, with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our\nprovision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\nNote 12. Stockholders’ Equity\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nOur board of directors has authorized 100,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. As of December 31, 2012 and 2013, there were no shares issued or outstanding.\nClass A and Class B Common Stock\nOur board of directors has authorized two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. At December 31, 2013, there were 9,000,000,000 and 3,000,000,000 shares authorized and there were 279,325,564 and 56,506,728 shares outstanding of Class A and Class B common stock, $0.001 par value. The rights of the holders of Class A and Class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock. We refer to Class A and Class B common stock as common stock throughout the notes to these financial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nStock Split Effected In Form of Stock Dividend\nIn April 2012, our board of directors approved amendments to our certificate of incorporation that would, among other things, create a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock). The amendments authorized 3 billion shares of Class C capital stock and also increased the authorized shares of Class A common stock from 6 billion to 9 billion. The amendments are reflected in our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (New Charter), the adoption of which was approved by stockholders at our 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 21, 2012. In January 2014, our board of directors considered and approved a distribution of shares of the Class C capital stock as a dividend to our holders of Class A and Class B common stock (Dividend). The Dividend will have a record date of March 27, 2014 and a payment date of April 2, 2014. The Class C capital stock will have no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Except as expressly provided in the New Charter, shares of Class C capital stock will have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and be identical in all other respects to the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock as to all matters.\nIn accordance with the settlement of litigation involving the authorization to distribute the Class C capital stock, we may be obligated to make a payment to holders of the Class C stock if, on average, Class C trades below Class A in the first year following the Class C issuance, payable in cash, Class A stock, Class C stock, or a combination thereof, at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Because the Class C shares have not yet been issued or commenced trading, we cannot reliably predict what, if any, patterns will emerge over time with respect to the relative trading prices of Class A and Class C shares.\nThe par value per share of our shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will remain unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Dividend. On the effective date of the Dividend, there will be a transfer between retained earnings and common stock and the amount transferred will be equal to the $0.001 par value of the Class C capital stock that is issued. We will give retroactive effect to prior period share and per share amounts in our consolidated financial statements for the effect of the Dividend, such that prior periods are comparable to current period presentation.\nStock Plans\nWe maintain the 1998 Stock Plan, the 2000 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan, the 2003 Stock Plan (No. 2), the 2003 Stock Plan (No. 3), the 2004 Stock Plan, the 2012 Stock Plan, and plans assumed through acquisitions, all of which are collectively referred to as the “Stock Plans.” Under our Stock Plans, incentive and non-qualified stock options or rights to purchase common stock may be granted to eligible participants. Options are generally granted for a term of 10 years. Under the Stock Plans, we have also issued RSUs. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our stock at the time the award vests. Except for options granted pursuant to our stock option exchange program completed in March 2009 (the Exchange), options granted and RSUs issued to participants under the Stock Plans generally vest over four years contingent upon employment or service with us on the vesting date.\nAs of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, there were 15,833,050 and 9,455,085 shares of common stock reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plans.\nWe estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the BSM option pricing model. Our assumptions about stock-price volatility have been based exclusively on the implied volatilities of publicly traded options to buy our stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life of options granted to our employees. We estimate the expected term based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock options granted in the periods presented:\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our options for the year ended December 31, 2013:\n(1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the closing stock price of $1,120.71 of our Class A common stock on December 31, 2013.\n(2) Options expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nThe following table summarizes additional information regarding outstanding, and vested and exercisable stock options as of December 31, 2013:\nThe above tables include 388,324 warrants held by selected financial institutions that were options purchased from employees under our TSO program, with a weighted-average exercise price of $431.76 and a weighted-average remaining life of 0.6 years.\nDuring 2013, the number of shares underlying TSOs sold to selected financial institutions under the TSO program was 671,190 at a total value of $322 million, or an average of $479.06 per share, including an average premium of $2.35 per share. The premium is calculated as the difference between (a) the sale price of the TSO and (b) the intrinsic value of the TSO, which we define as the excess, if any, of the price of our Class A common stock at the time of the sale over the exercise price of the TSO. The TSO program was discontinued as of November 29, 2013. This did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe total grant date fair value of stock options vested during 2011, 2012, and 2013 was $561 million, $489 million, and $223 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of all options and warrants exercised during 2011, 2012, and 2013 was $674 million, $827 million, and $1,793 million. These amounts do not include the aggregate sales price of options sold under our TSO program.\nAs of December 31, 2013, there was $188 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding employee stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2013:\n(1)\nRSUs expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nAs of December 31, 2013, there was $6.2 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested employee RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nNote 13. 401(k) Plans\nWe have two 401(k) Savings Plans (401(k) Plans) that qualify as deferred salary arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these 401(k) Plans, matching contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’ contributions subject to certain limitations. We contributed approximately $136 million, $180 million, and $216 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013.\nNote 14. Income Taxes\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $4,693 million, $5,311 million, and $5,828 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013, and income from foreign operations of $7,633 million, $8,075 million, and $8,668 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013.\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions):\nThe reconciliation of federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):\nA retroactive extension of the 2012 federal research and development credit was signed into law on January 2, 2013 in accordance with The American Taxpayer Act of 2012. The benefit of $189 million related to the 2012 federal research and development credit is included in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nWe have not provided U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of December 31, 2013, the cumulative amount of earnings upon\nwhich U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $38.9 billion. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.\nDeferred Tax Assets\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2013, our federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $440 million, $1,247 million and $824 million. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2019 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2014. The foreign net operating loss can be carried forward indefinitely, however it is more likely than not that it will not be realized, therefore we have recorded a valuation allowance against all material foreign net operation losses. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2013, our California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $450 million that can be carried over indefinitely. We believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the state tax credit will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a full valuation allowance on the state tax credit carryforward. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nAs of December 31, 2013, our foreign tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $228 million that will start to expire in 2023. We believe it is more likely than not that all of the foreign tax credit will be realized. We will reassess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis and if future evidence supports a need to establish a valuation allowance, then a tax expense will be recorded accordingly.\nAs of December 31, 2013, our federal and state capital loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $349 million and $560 million. We also have deferred tax assets for impairment losses that, if recognized, will be capital in nature. We believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets for capital losses and impairment losses will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance on both our\nfederal and state deferred tax assets for these items. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nIn December 2012, we entered into an agreement with Arris Group Inc. (Arris) for the disposition of the Motorola Home segment. A deferred tax asset was established for the book to tax basis difference in our investment in the Motorola Home segment upon signing the agreement because the basis difference was going to be recognized in the foreseeable future. In April 2013, upon the disposition of the Home segment to Arris, our basis difference in the Home segment became a basis difference in Google’s investment in Arris shares received in the disposition and was adjusted by the amount of cash received as part of the transaction. Since any future losses to be recognized upon the disposition of Arris shares will be capital losses and we already have an excess capital loss carryforward, a full valuation allowance was recorded against this deferred tax asset. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits from January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2013 (in millions):\nOur total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $1,350 million, $1,749 million, and $2,378 million as of December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2012 and 2013, we had accrued $139 million and $181 million for payment of interest and penalties. Interest and penalties included in our provision for income taxes were not material in all the periods presented.\nWe and our subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. Although we file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns, our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and Ireland. During the quarter ended December 31, 2007, the IRS completed its examination of our 2003 and 2004 tax years. We have filed an appeal with the IRS for certain issues related to this audit and settlements were reached in 2012 on all but one issue which we plan to litigate in court. As a result we released the related reserves in the quarter ended December 31, 2012. The IRS is currently in examination of our 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years. We expect the examination to be completed\nwithin the next 12 months, but we do not anticipate any significant impact to our unrecognized tax benefit balance as of December 31, 2013, related to our 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years.\nOur 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes, and our 2006 through 2013 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are various other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\nNote 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nSubsequent to the completion of our disposition of the Motorola Home segment on April 17, 2013, we operate in the following two operating segments:\n•\nGoogle - includes our advertising and other non-advertising businesses\n•\nMotorola Mobile - includes our mobile devices business acquired from Motorola\nOur chief operating decision maker does not evaluate operating segments using asset information.\nThe following table sets forth revenues and operating income (loss) by operating segment (in millions):\n(1) Beginning in the third quarter of 2013, Google and Motorola Mobile segment revenues have been impacted by intersegment transactions that are eliminated in consolidation. Additionally, segment revenues associated with certain products are recognized in the segment results, but deferred to future periods in our consolidated financial statements.\n(2) Unallocated items, including stock-based compensation expense, as well as restructuring and other charges are not allocated to each segment because we do not include this information in our measurement of the performance of our operating segments.\nRevenues by geography are based on the billing addresses of our customers for the Google segment and the ship-to-addresses of our customers for the Motorola Mobile segment. The following tables set forth revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area (in millions):\n(1)\nIncludes the Motorola Home segment as of December 31, 2012\nNote 16. Subsequent Events\nAcquisition of Nest\nIn January 2014, we entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of Nest Labs, Inc. (Nest), a company whose mission is to reinvent devices in the home such as thermostats and smoke alarms, for a total purchase price of $3.2 billion in cash, subject to adjustments. Prior to this transaction, we had an approximately 12% ownership interest in Nest, which was net against the total consideration. We expect that the acquisition will enhance Google's suite of products and services and allow Nest to continue to innovate upon devices in the home, making them more useful, intuitive, and thoughtful, and to reach more users in more countries. The transaction closed on February 7, 2014.\nThis transaction is considered a “step acquisition” under GAAP whereby our ownership interest in Nest held before the acquisition is required to be remeasured to fair value at the date of the acquisition. The gain as a result of remeasurement will be included in “interest and other income, net” on our Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of 2014.\nWe are currently in the process of valuing the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction, and determining the fair value of our previously held ownership interest at the acquisition date. We will provide all required disclosures upon the completion of the valuation in the first quarter of 2014.\nDivestiture of Motorola Mobile\nOn January 29, 2014, we entered into an agreement with Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo) providing for the disposition of the Motorola Mobile segment for a total purchase price of approximately $2.9 billion (subject to certain adjustments), including $1.4 billion to be paid at close, comprised of $660 million in cash and $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares (subject to a share cap and floor). The remaining $1.5 billion will be paid in the form of an interest-free, three-year prepayable promissory note.\nWe will maintain ownership of the vast majority of the Motorola Mobile patent portfolio, including current patent applications and invention disclosures, which will be licensed back to Motorola Mobile for its continued operations. Lenovo will receive over 2,000 patent assets, as well as the Motorola Mobility brand and trademark portfolio. Additionally, in connection with the sale, we will indemnify Lenovo for certain potential liabilities of the Motorola Mobile business. The transaction is subject to the satisfaction of regulatory requirements, customary closing conditions and any other needed approvals and is expected to close in 2014.\nAs we evaluate the impact of this agreement, we expect financial results of Motorola Mobile will be presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Income and assets and liabilities of Motorola Mobile to be disposed of will be presented as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets beginning in the first quarter of 2014.\nWe are in the process of evaluating the transaction and its impact on our financial statements, including evaluating the resulting gain or loss that will be recognized, based on all the terms of the agreement. The following table presents our best estimate of the aggregate carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities related to the Motorola Mobile segment to be disposed of as of December 31, 2013 (in millions):",
         "ITEM 9.\nCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.",
         "ITEM 9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2013, our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2013 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2013. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.",

         "ITEM 1.\nBUSINESS\nOverview\nOur founders started Google because they share a profound sense of optimism about the potential for technology to create a positive impact in the world. As Larry and Sergey explained in their first letter to shareholders, our goal is to: “... develop services that significantly improve the lives of as many people as possible.”\nIn many ways, Google itself began with a series of questions: What if we could download and index the entire web? What if we could organize all the world’s information? And then we went out and searched for the answers.\nWe know we’ve found the right answers when they pass what we call the \"toothbrush test,\" whether this product will be used by hundreds of millions of people everyday, hopefully twice a day.\nWe are proud of everything we have managed to do. Our innovations in search and advertising have made our website widely used and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. We generate revenues primarily by delivering online advertising that consumers find relevant and that advertisers find cost-effective.\nWe were incorporated in California in September 1998 and reincorporated in Delaware in August 2003. We provide our products and services in more than 100 languages and in more than 50 countries, regions, and territories. Additional information on our financial performance by geographic areas can be found in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nServing Our Users\nIn many ways search -- and the clean white page with the blinking cursor -- is a metaphor for how we think about innovation at Google. Imagining the ways things could be -- without constraint -- is the process we use to look for better answers to some of life’s everyday problems. It’s about starting with the \"What if?\" and then working relentlessly to see if we can find the answer.\nIt’s been that way from the beginning; providing ways to access knowledge and information has been core to Google and our products have come a long way in the last decade. We used to show just ten blue links in our results. You had to click through to different websites to get your answers, which took time. Now we are increasingly able to provide direct answers -- even if you’re speaking your question using Voice Search -- which makes it quicker, easier and more natural to find what you’re looking for.\nOver time, we have added other services that let you access information quickly and easily. What if we could develop a smarter email service with plenty of storage? That’s Gmail. What if we could make a simpler, speedier, safer browser? That’s Chrome. What if we could provide easy access to movies, books, music and apps, no matter which device you’re on? That’s Google Play.\nAs devices proliferate, it’s more and more important to ensure that you can navigate effortlessly across them -- that the technology gets out of the way, so you can move through this multi-screen world as easily as possible. It’s why we’re investing so much in platforms like our Chrome browser and our Android mobile operating system. Ultimately, we want you to have speedy, secure access to whatever you need, wherever you happen to be, and on whatever device you may be using at the time.\nAds as Answers\nWe asked, what if ads weren't intrusive and annoying? What if we could deliver a relevant ad at just the right time and give people useful commercial information? What if we could provide products that allow for better attribution and measurement across screens so that we show great ads for the right people?\nOur advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses, and we offer a wide range of products across screens and devices. We generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising.\n•\nPerformance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Most of our performance advertisers pay us on a cost-per-engagement basis, like when a user engages in their ads. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results.\nFor performance advertisers, AdWords, our primary auction-based advertising program, helps create simple text-based ads that appear on Google websites and the websites of Google Network Members, who\nuse our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads alongside their search results and content. In addition, the partners that comprise the Google Network use our AdSense program to deliver relevant ads that generate revenues and enhance the user experience. These programs let both small and large businesses connect with users looking for a specific item, say a pair of shoes or a plane ticket back home. To that end, we continue to invest in our advertising programs and to make significant upgrades, including Enhanced Campaigns, which helps advertisers more easily create advertising and marketing campaigns that run across multiple devices, and Estimated Total Conversions, which help advertisers measure the effectiveness of their campaigns in a multi-screen world.\n•\nBrand advertising helps enhance users’ awareness of and affinity with advertisers’ products and services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns and in turn, generate revenue by distributing their ads such as the TrueView ads displayed on our YouTube videos.\nWe have built a world-class ad technology platform for brand advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses across display, mobile, and video. We aim to ensure great user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. We also seek to improve the measurability of the effectiveness of brand advertising.\nIn addition, we have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. Our efforts to focus on our users to ensure the best advertising experiences range from removing hundreds of millions of bad ads from our systems every year to closely monitoring the sites and apps that show our ads and blacklisting them when necessary to ensure that our ads do not fund bad content.\nBringing the Next 5 Billion Online\nFast search and high-quality ads matter only if you have access to the Internet. Right now, only a fraction of the seven billion people in the world are fortunate enough to be able to get online. That leaves out billions of people. With so much useful and life-changing information available today, it is unfortunate that such a significant portion of the world’s population lacks even the most basic Internet connection.\nThat’s why we’re investing in new projects, like Project Loon. We asked, what if we could use a network of balloons that could fly at the edge of space and provide connectivity in rural and remote areas? Loon has helped students in Brazil and farmers in New Zealand experience the power of an internet connection for the first time. And as the program expands, we hope to bring this to more and more people -- creating opportunities that simply did not exist before for millions of people, all around the world.\nThose people will be able to learn and start businesses, to grow and prosper in ways they simply could not without an Internet connection. Creating platforms for other people’s success is a huge part of who we are. We want the world to join us online and to be greeted with the best possible experience once they get there. Connection is powerful; and we are working hard to make that promise a reality. The opportunities to improve lives on a grand scale are endless. And there are people around the world whose lives we can improve every day by bringing information into their homes, into their schools, and into their pockets -- showing them just how powerful the simple idea of “getting online” can be.\nMoonshots\nThe idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making a few incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term.\nWe won’t become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders’ IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects because we believe they are the key to our long-term success. We won’t stop asking “What if?” and then working hard to find the answer.\nResearch\nWe continue to invest in our existing products and services, including search and advertising, as well as developing new products and services through research and product development. We often release early-stage products. We then use data and user feedback to decide if and how to invest further in those products.\nOur research and development expenses were $6.1 billion, $7.1 billion, and $9.8 billion in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively, which included stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 billion, $1.6 billion, and $2.2 billion, respectively. We expect to continue investing in hiring talented employees and building systems to develop new services and improve existing ones.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with online information and provide them with relevant advertising. We face competition from:\n•\nGeneral purpose search engines and information services, such as Yahoo, Microsoft’s Bing, Yandex, Baidu, Naver, WebCrawler, and MyWebSearch.\n•\nVertical search engines and e-commerce websites, such as Kayak (travel queries), LinkedIn (job queries), WebMD (health queries), and Amazon and eBay (e-commerce). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n•\nSocial networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. Some users are increasingly relying on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n•\nOther forms of advertising, such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, and yellow pages, for ad dollars. Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n•\nOther online advertising platforms and networks, including Criteo, AppNexus, and Facebook, that compete for advertisers with AdWords, our primary auction-based advertising program.\n•\nOther operating systems and mobile device companies.\n•\nProviders of online products and services that provide answers, information, and services. A number of our online products and services, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs, compete directly with new and established companies, which offer communication, information, storage and entertainment services, either on a stand-alone basis or integrated into other offerings.\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to rapidly deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace so that we can attract and retain:\n•\nUsers, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, primarily on the basis of the relevance and usefulness of our search results and the features, availability, and ease of use of our products and services.\n•\nAdvertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner.\n•\nContent providers (Google Network Members, the parties who use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads alongside their search results and content, as well as other content providers for whom we distribute or license content), primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the US and foreign countries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties.\nCulture and Employees\nWe take great pride in our culture. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex technical challenges. Transparency and open dialogue are central to how we work, and we like to ensure that company news reaches our employees first through internal channels.\nDespite our rapid growth, we still cherish our roots as a startup and wherever possible empower employees to act on great ideas regardless of their role or function within the company. We strive to hire great employees, with backgrounds and perspectives as diverse as those of our global users. We work to provide an environment where these talented people can have fulfilling careers addressing some of the biggest challenges in technology and society.\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue investing in hiring talented employees and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees. As of December 31, 2014, we had 53,600 full-time employees: 20,832 in research and development, 17,621 in sales and marketing, 7,510 in general and administrative functions, and 7,637 in operations. Although we have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a\nlabor union. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by both seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage and traditional retail seasonality. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year.\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.google.com, and our investor relations website is located at http://investor.google.com. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our Proxy Statements are available through our investor relations website, free of charge, after we file them with the SEC. We also provide a link to the section of the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov that has all of the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC.

         "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common and capital stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is rapidly evolving, intensely competitive, and is subject to changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to rapidly deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace and provide products and services that make our search results and ads relevant and useful for our users. As our business has evolved, the competitive pressure to innovate will now encompass a wider range of products and services, including products and services that may be outside of our historical core business.\nWe have many competitors in different industries, including general purpose search engines and information services, vertical search engines and e-commerce websites, social networks, providers of online products and services, other forms of advertising and online advertising platforms and networks, other operating systems, and wireless mobile device companies. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Established companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users, and they can use their experience and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in research and development, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete aggressively for advertisers and websites. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the consumer need for products and services before us.\nOur competitors are constantly developing innovations in search, online advertising, wireless mobile devices, operating systems, and many other web-based products and services. The research and development of new, technologically advanced products is also a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment, as well as the accurate anticipation of technology, market trends, and consumer needs. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our search technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. If we are unable to provide quality products and services, then acceptance rates for our products and services could decline. In addition, these new products and services may present new and difficult technological and legal challenges, and we may be subject to claims if users of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other issues. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, and Google Network Members, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities, or are not effectively brought to market. As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer user experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, and content providers, our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our ongoing businesses.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including distraction of management from current operations, insufficient revenues from such investments to offset liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nMore people are using devices other than desktop computers to access the Internet and accessing new devices to make search queries. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our search technology, products, or operating systems developed for these devices, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through devices other than desktop computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets, video game consoles, and television set-top devices, is increasing dramatically. The functionality and user experience associated with some alternative devices make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult (or just different) and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users, manufacturers, or distributors of alternative devices. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via “apps” tailored to particular devices or social media platforms, which could affect our search and advertising business over time. As new devices and platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, distributors, developers, and users to our products and services, or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms, we will fail to capture the opportunities available as consumers and advertisers transition to a dynamic, multi-screen environment.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and a reduction in spending by or loss of advertisers could seriously harm our business.\nWe generated 89% of Google revenues from our advertisers in 2014. Our advertisers can generally terminate their contracts with us at any time. Advertisers will not continue to do business with us if their investment in advertising with us does not generate sales leads or brand awareness, and ultimately customers, or if we do not deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner. If we are unable to remain competitive and provide value to our advertisers, they may stop placing ads with us, which would adversely affect our revenues and business.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, which could adversely affect our revenues and business.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including as a result of:\n•\nincreasing competition,\n•\nchanges in property mix, platform mix, and geographical mix,\n•\nthe challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels,\n•\nthe evolution of the online advertising market, including the increasing variety of online platforms for advertising, and the other markets in which we participate, and\n•\nthe rate of user adoption of our products, services, and technologies.\nWe believe our operating margin will experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased expenditures for many aspects of our business. For instance, our operating margin will experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our Google Network Members’ websites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on Google websites or if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote the distribution of certain products. The margin on revenues we generate from our Google Network Members is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on Google websites. Also, the margin on the sale of digital content and apps, advertising revenues from mobile devices and newer advertising formats are generally less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites on traditional formats. Additionally, the margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network Members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google Network Members.\nWe are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business.\nThe growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields involve a variety of new regulatory issues, and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown. For instance, several regulatory agencies have sought to review our search and other businesses on potential competition concerns. We continue to cooperate with the European Commission (EC) and other regulatory authorities around the world in investigations they are conducting with respect to our business and its impact on competition. Legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material ways.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. The sale of hardware products also exposes us to the risk of product liability and other litigation involving assertions about product defects, as well as health and safety, hazardous materials usage, and other environmental concerns. In addition, our businesses face intellectual property litigation, as further discussed later, that exposes us to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell products and services.\nSuch claims, suits, and government investigations are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. It is possible that a resolution of one\nor more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in our business practices or product recalls or other field action, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:\n•\nDiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges.\n•\nFailure to successfully further develop the acquired business or technology.\n•\nImplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.\n•\nIntegration of the acquired company's accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions.\n•\nTransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.\n•\nFailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval, under competition laws which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or investment.\n•\nIn the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\n•\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire.\n•\nLiability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, privacy issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.\n•\nLitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\nOur acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or results. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions or investments may not materialize.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners.\nOur strong brand has significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing our brand increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users. Our brand may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues and product/technical performance failures. Further, if we fail to maintain and enhance equity in the Google brand, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in people’s everyday lives.\nA variety of new and existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. For example, current and new patent laws such as U.S. patent laws and European patent laws may affect the ability of companies, including us, to protect their innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future.\nClaims have been, or may be, threatened and filed against us under both U.S. and foreign laws for defamation, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, product liability, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users, our products and services, or content generated by our users. Furthermore, many of these laws do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by a number of our new businesses, products, services and technologies. In addition, the applicability and scope of these laws, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain. For example, the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the U.S. and abroad.\nIn addition, other laws that could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business include:\n•\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which has provisions that limit in the U.S., but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for caching or hosting, or for listing or linking to, third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Any future legislation impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact us.\n•\nCourt decisions such as the ‘right to be forgotten’ ruling issued by the European court, which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them in certain instances, may limit the content we can show to our users.\n•\nVarious U.S. and international laws that restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors.\n•\nData protection, laws passed by many states that require notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California’s Information Practices Act.\nWe face similar risks and costs overseas as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property or other claims, which are costly to defend, could result in significant damage awards, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nInternet, technology, media, and other companies own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As we have grown, the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies.\nWe have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell our products or services\nin the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.\nFurthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities. In addition, many of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers from covered products.\nRegardless of the merits of the claims, intellectual property claims are often time consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and cause significant diversion of management attention. To the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful, they may have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective.\nAlthough we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.\nWe also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.\nWe may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.\nWe host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat unsettled both within the U.S. and internationally. Claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright or trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties, including our users. In addition, we are and have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions\nalleging that certain content we have generated or third-party content that we have made available within our services violates U.S. and non-U.S. law.\nWe also arrange for the distribution of third-party advertisements to third-party publishers and advertising networks, and we offer third-party products, services, or content. We may be subject to claims concerning these products, services, or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting, or providing access to them, even if we do not ourselves host, operate, provide, or provide access to these products, services, or content. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources, may result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services.\nFrom time to time, concerns have been expressed about whether our products, services, or processes compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, as nearly all of our products and services are web-based, the amount of data we store for our users on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users’ data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We expect to continue to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based products and services we offer, and operate in more countries.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, including measures to ensure that our encryption of users’ data does not hinder law enforcement agencies’ access to that data. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of users’ and customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or our users’ or customers’ data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers.\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results and prospects.\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management. For instance, the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from the software used in the product. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or\nsuppliers. If the quality of our products does not meet our customers' expectations or our products are found to be defective, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products, and we have third-party arrangements for the design of some components and parts. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.\nWe have in the past, and may experience in the future, supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural disasters and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. Workaround plans to address shortages could entail increased freight costs for expedited shipments. We may experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could negatively impact our operations. In addition, some of the components we use in our products are available only from a single source or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain disruption.\nAdditionally, because many of our supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our hardware products more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results. Further, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supply.\nWe also require our suppliers and business partners to comply with law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. If any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical, we could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations of or damage to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. If any of them fails to procure necessary license rights to third-party intellectual property, legal action could ensue that could impact the saleability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third parties.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries (DRC) and procedures pertaining to a manufacturer's efforts regarding the source of such minerals. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply DRC “conflict free” components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain DRC conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals used in our products.\nWeb spam and content farms could decrease our search quality, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\n“Web spam” refers to websites that attempt to violate a search engine's quality guidelines or that otherwise seek to rank higher in search results than a search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them.\nAlthough English-language web spam in our search results has been significantly reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek ways to improve their rankings inappropriately. We continuously combat web spam, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We face challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including “content farms”, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve their search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes focused on low-quality websites. If our search results display an increasing number of web spam and content farms, this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce user traffic to our websites. In addition, as we continue to take actions to improve our search quality and reduce low-quality content, this may in the short run reduce our AdSense revenues, since some of these websites are AdSense partners.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of certain of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in our services or the failure of our systems.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 57% of our consolidated revenues in 2014. In certain international markets, we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:\n•\nChanges in local political, economic, regulatory, social, and labor conditions, which may adversely harm our business.\n•\nRestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.\n•\nImport and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, and customs classifications that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market and may increase our operating costs.\n•\nLonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.\n•\nStill developing foreign laws and legal systems.\n•\nUncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent.\n•\nDifferent employee/employer relationships, existence of workers' councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\nIn addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, privacy and data protection requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and competition regulations, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international growth efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nFinally, since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may\nadversely affect our revenues and earnings. Additionally, hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date, and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this section in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results:\n•\nOur ability to continue to attract users to our websites and retain existing users on our websites.\n•\nOur ability to monetize (or generate revenues from) traffic on Google websites and our Google Network Members' websites both on desktop and mobile devices.\n•\nRevenue fluctuations caused by changes in property mix, platform mix, and geographical mix.\n•\nThe amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and our ability to manage the resulting risk through our foreign exchange risk management program.\n•\nThe amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure.\n•\nOur focus on long-term goals over short-term results.\n•\nThe results of our acquisitions and our investments in risky projects, including new businesses, products, services, and technologies.\n•\nOur ability to keep our websites operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions.\n•\nOur ability to generate significant revenues from new products and services in which we have invested considerable time and resources.\nBecause our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results. In addition, advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. Also, user traffic tends to be seasonal. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.\nIf we were to lose the services of Larry, Sergey, Eric, or other key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In particular, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are critical to the overall management of Google and the development of our technology. Along with our Executive Chairman Eric E. Schmidt, they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our\ncontinued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take measures, including legal actions, that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or blockages. Such interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth.\nNew technologies could block online ads, which would harm our business.\nTechnologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of our advertising products. Most of our revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages for our users. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investments.\nGiven the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally. Credit ratings and market values of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various tax-related assertions, including transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Stock\nThe trading price for our Class A common stock may continue to be volatile and the trading price for our newly distributed non-voting Class C capital stock may also be volatile.\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example, from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the closing price of our Class A common stock, retroactively adjusted as if the Stock Split occurred on January 1, 2014, ranged from $498.16 per share to $610.70 per share, and from April 3, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the closing price of our Class C capital stock ranged from $495.39 to $596.08 per share.\nIn addition, following the settlement of litigation involving the authorization to distribute our non-voting Class C capital stock, our board of directors approved a distribution of shares of Class C capital stock as a dividend to our holders of Class A and Class B common stock with a payment date of April 2, 2014, and on April 3, 2014, Class C capital stock was listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market. In accordance with the settlement, we may be obligated to make a payment to holders of Class C capital stock if, on average, Class C capital stock trades below Class A common stock during the first 365 days following the first date the Class C capital stock trades. If such a payment is required, it must be made to holders of the Class C stock in cash, Class A stock, Class C stock, or a combination thereof, at the discretion of the board of directors. For further disclosure regarding this potential payment, please refer to Note 12 “Stockholders’ Equity - Stock Split Effected in Form of Stock Dividend” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Over time, we cannot reliably predict what, if any, patterns will emerge with respect to the relative trading prices of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n•\nQuarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors.\n•\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments.\n•\nRecommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.\n•\nAnnouncements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance on earnings.\n•\nAnnouncements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.\n•\nCommentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other matters affecting our business and results, regardless of its accuracy.\n•\nThe volume of shares of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock available for public sale.\n•\nSales of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by our directors, executive officers, and other employees).\n•\nShort sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock.\n•\nThe perceived values of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock relative to one another.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock regardless of our actual operating performance.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A common stock has one vote per share, and our Class C capital stock has no voting rights. As of December 31, 2014, Larry, Sergey, and Eric beneficially owned approximately 92.5% of our outstanding Class B common stock, which represented approximately 60.1% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Larry, Sergey, and Eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant\ncorporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C capital stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C capital stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could prolong the duration of Larry and Sergey’s current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Together with Eric, they would also continue to be able to control any required stockholder vote with respect to certain change in control transactions involving Google (including an acquisition of Google by another company).\nThis concentrated control limits or severely restricts our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock could be adversely affected.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry, Sergey, and Eric have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. As noted above, the issuance of the Class C capital stock could have the effect of prolonging the influence of Larry, Sergey, and Eric.\n•\nOur board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.\n•\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting.\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n•\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n•\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.",

         "ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business\nThe following trends have contributed to the results of our operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to impact our future results:\n•User behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nThe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since our inception, resulting in increasing revenues, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business.\n•Users are increasingly using multiple devices to access our products and services, and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from mobile phones and other new formats.\nOur users are accessing the Internet via multiple devices. Mobile computing power continues to grow and users want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of this shift in order to maintain and grow our business.\nIn this multi-device world, we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile phones and newer advertising formats, and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from desktop computers and tablets. Our traffic acquisition cost (TAC) may also be impacted because the rates at which we share mobile revenues with our partners may not be as favorable to us as those with our traditional desktop and tablet formats. We expect both of these trends to continue to pressure our overall margins, particularly if we fail to realize the opportunities presented during the transition to a dynamic multi-screen environment.\n•As users in developing economies increasingly come online, we generate more and more revenues from international markets.\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., especially in emerging markets, and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets. This has led to increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be impacted by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available.\nOur international revenues have gone from 55% of total revenues in 2013 to 57% in 2014. As a result, we are increasingly subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n•As we seek to provide our users with products and services in a multi-screen environment, the portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing.\nNon-advertising revenues have gone from 9% of total revenues in 2013 to 11% in 2014. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings to our users through products like Google Play, Google for Work, and Nexus devices. We derive other revenues primarily from sales of digital content products, hardware sales, and licensing. The margins on these non-advertising businesses vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising business.\n•As we continue to look for new ways to serve our users, we will invest heavily in R&D and our capital expenditures will continue to fluctuate.\nWe continue to make significant research and development (R&D) investments in areas of strategic focus, such as search and advertising, as well as in new products and services. The amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the long term as we invest heavily in our systems, data centers, real estate and facilities, and information technology infrastructure.\nIn addition, acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy and use of capital, and we expect to continue to spend cash on acquisitions and other investments. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expanding our expertise in engineering and other functional areas.\n•Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. Their energy and talent drive Google and create our success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees. As of December 31, 2014, we had 53,600 full-time employees: 20,832 in research and development, 17,621 in sales and marketing, 7,510 in general and administrative, and 7,637 in operations, an increase of 9,738 total headcount from December 31, 2013.\nExecutive Overview of Results\nHere are our key financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014:\n•\nConsolidated revenues increased 18.9% to $66.0 billion, primarily driven by an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google websites and an increase in other revenues, and to a lesser extent, an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google Network Members' websites.\n•\nRevenues from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Rest of World were, $28.1 billion, $6.5 billion, and $31.4 billion, respectively.\n•\nCost of revenues was $25.7 billion, consisting of traffic acquisition costs of $13.5 billion and other cost of revenues of $12.2 billion. Our traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was 22.9%.\n•\nOperating expenses (excluding cost of revenues) were $23.8 billion, primarily driven by labor and facilities-related costs for our research and development and sales and marketing functions, advertising and promotional expenses, and stock-based compensation expense.\n•\nIncome from operations was $16.5 billion.\n•\nEffective tax rate was 19.3%.\n•\nNet income was $14.4 billion with diluted earnings per share of $21.02.\n•\nOperating cash flow was $22.4 billion.\n•\nCapital expenditures were $11.0 billion.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our operating results as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented:\nMotorola\nOn May 22, 2012, we acquired Motorola Mobility Holdings, Inc. (Motorola), consisting of the Motorola Home and Motorola Mobile businesses. On April 17, 2013, we sold the Motorola Home business to Arris Group, Inc. (Arris). The financial results of Motorola Home were included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013. On October 29, 2014 we sold the Motorola\nMobile business to Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo). The financial results of Motorola Mobile are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014.\nRevenues\nThe following table presents our revenues, by revenue source, for the periods presented (in millions):\nThe following table presents our revenues, by revenue source, as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented:\nAdvertising Revenues and Monetization Metrics\nOur advertising revenues increased $8,509 million from 2013 to 2014 primarily from an increase in advertising revenues generated by both Google websites and Google Network Members' websites. Our advertising revenues growth was driven primarily by an increase in the number of aggregate paid clicks through our advertising programs of 20% from 2013 to 2014. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to certain monetization improvements including new and richer ad formats, an increase in aggregate traffic across all platforms, the continued global expansion of our products, advertisers, and user base, and an increase in the number of Google Network Members, partially offset by certain advertising policy changes. The positive impact of our revenues from paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers of 5% from 2013 to 2014. The decrease was due to various factors, such as the geographic mix, device mix, property mix, ongoing product and policy changes, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\nOur advertising revenues increased $6,861 million from 2012 to 2013. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google websites, and to a lesser extent, an increase in advertising revenues generated by Google Network Members' websites. The increase in advertising revenues for Google websites and Google Network Members' websites resulted primarily from an increase in the number of paid clicks through our advertising programs, as paid clicks on Google websites and Google Network Members' websites increased approximately 25% from 2012 to 2013. The increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs was due to certain monetization improvements including new and richer ad formats, an increase in aggregate traffic across all platforms, the continued global expansion of our products, advertisers, and user base, as well as an increase in the number of Google Network Members, partially offset by certain advertising policy changes. This revenue\nincrease was partially offset by a decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. Average cost-per-click on Google websites and Google Network Members' websites decreased approximately 8% from 2012 to 2013. The decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers was driven by various factors, such as the geographic mix, device mix, property mix, ongoing product and policy changes, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\nOur revenue growth rate has generally declined over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, query growth rates, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, the evolution of the online advertising market, our investments in new business strategies, changes in our product mix, and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, advertising trends, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices, and our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers.\nThe following table presents the changes in our paid clicks and cost-per-click for the periods presented (in percentage terms):\nThe rate of change in revenues, as well as the rate of change in paid clicks and average cost-per-click on Google websites and Google Network Members' websites and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors, including:\n•\ngrowth rates of our revenues from Google websites compared to those of our revenues from Google Network Members' websites;\n•\nadvertiser competition for keywords;\n•\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nseasonality;\n•\nthe fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;\n•\nchanges in advertising quality or formats;\n•\ntraffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels;\n•\na shift in the proportion of non-click based revenue generated in Google websites and Google Network Members' websites; and\n•\ngeneral economic conditions.\nChanges in aggregate paid clicks and average cost-per-click on Google websites and Google Network Members' websites may not reflect our performance or advertiser experiences in any specific geographic market, vertical, or industry.\nOther Revenues\nOther revenues increased $1,973 million from 2013 to 2014 and also increased as a percentage of total revenues. The increase was primarily due to growth of our sales of digital content products, such as apps, music, and movies on the Google Play store.\nOther revenues increased $2,619 million from 2012 to 2013 and also increased as a percentage of revenues. The increase was primarily due to growth of our digital content products, such as apps, music, and movies. We also\nexperienced an increase in our hardware revenues due to increased sales of Chromecast, directly-sold Nexus products, and Chrome OS devices.\nRevenues by Geography\nThe following table presents our domestic and international revenues as a percentage of revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our customers:\nThe growth in revenues from rest of the world as a percentage of revenues from 2012 to 2013 and from 2013 to 2014 resulted largely from increased acceptance of our advertising programs and our continued progress in developing localized versions of our products for international markets, partially offset in 2014 by the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies.\nForeign Exchange Impact on Revenues\nOur international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. For the purposes of determining the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our revenues, we take the U.S. dollar equivalent of foreign currency-denominated revenues of a particular period translated at the current period exchange rates minus the same revenues translated at corresponding prior year rates.\nWe use foreign currency options to hedge certain foreign exchange impacts on our forecasted earnings. To the extent these derivatives are effective in managing our foreign exchange risk, we will reflect the hedge benefit in revenues in the period the hedged revenues are recorded. We pay a premium reflecting the time value of the option on the date of purchase. The changes in the time value of the option are reflected in interest and other income, net, over the life of the option, in the period incurred.\nThe following table presents our foreign exchange impact on revenues for the periods presented:\nIn 2014, our revenues from the United Kingdom were favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates over the prior year, primarily as the U.S. dollar weakened relative to certain currencies, most notably the British pound. Our revenues from the rest of the world (excluding the United Kingdom) were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates over the prior year, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to certain currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar, and partially offset by the favorable impact of the U.S. dollar weakening against certain currencies, most notably the euro.\nIn 2013, our revenues from the United Kingdom were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates over the prior year, primarily as the U.S dollar strengthened relative to certain currencies, most notably the British pound. Our revenues from the rest of the world (excluding the United Kingdom) were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates over the prior year, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to certain currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and the Brazilian real, and partially offset by the favorable impact of the U.S. dollar weakening relative to certain currencies, including the euro.\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of traffic acquisition costs which are the advertising revenues shared with our Google Network Members and the amounts paid to our distribution partners who distribute our browser or otherwise direct search queries to our website.\nAdditionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues minus traffic acquisition costs) includes the following:\n•\nContent acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we share most of the fees these sales generate with content providers or pay a fixed fee to these content providers);\n•\nThe expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs);\n•\nInventory costs for hardware we sell;\n•\nStock-based compensation paid to our employees;\n•\nCredit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions; and\n•\nAmortization of certain intangible assets.\nThe following tables present our cost of revenues and cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, and our traffic acquisition costs and traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues, for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nThe cost of revenues that we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed through our AdSense program on the websites of our Google Network Members, which is the network of third parties that use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads with their search results and content, are significantly higher than the costs of revenues we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on Google websites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on Google Network Members’ websites are shared with our Google Network Members. For the past five years, growth in advertising revenues from Google websites has generally exceeded that from our Google Network Members’ websites. This had a positive impact on our income from operations during this period.\nCost of revenues increased $3,698 million from 2013 to 2014. The increase was partially due to increases in traffic acquisition costs of $1,239 million resulting from more distribution fees paid for additional traffic directed to Google websites, as well as more advertiser fees paid to Google Network Members, driven primarily by an increase in advertising revenues. The remaining increase was primarily driven by an increase in data center costs, content acquisition costs as a result of increased usage activities related to YouTube and digital content by our users, and revenue share payments to mobile carriers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In addition, the increase was also driven by an impairment charge related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired in connection with the Motorola acquisition. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily a result of a shift of mix between Google website revenue and Google Network Members' websites revenue.\nCost of revenues increased $4,817 million from 2012 to 2013. The increase was due to increases in traffic acquisition costs of $1,302 million resulting from more distribution fees paid, more fees paid for additional traffic directed to Google websites, as well as more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program. The remaining increase\nwas primarily driven by an increase in data center costs, hardware inventory costs as a result of increased hardware sales, content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to YouTube and digital content, and revenue share payments to mobile carriers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily as a result of a shift of mix between Google website revenue and Google Network Members' websites revenue.\nWe expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of total revenues in 2015 and future periods, based on a number of factors, including the following:\n•\nThe relative growth rates of revenues from Google websites and from our Google Network Members’ websites;\n•\nThe growth rates of expenses associated with our data center operations, as well as our hardware inventory costs;\n•\nIncreased proportion of other non-advertising revenues as part of our total revenues;\n•\nWhether we are able to enter into more revenue share arrangements with Google Network Members and distribution partners that provide for lower revenue share obligations or whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential Google Network Members and distribution partners results in less favorable revenue share arrangements;\n•\nWhether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on Google websites and our Google Network Members' websites; and\n•\nThe relative growth rates of expenses associated with distribution arrangements and the related revenues generated.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents our R&D expenses, and those expenses as a percentage of revenues, for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nR&D expenses consist primarily of:\n•\nLabor and facilities-related costs for employees responsible for R&D in our existing businesses as well as new products and services;\n•\nDepreciation and equipment-related expenses; and\n•\nStock-based compensation expense for employees responsible for R&D.\nR&D expenses increased $2,695 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from 2013 to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $1,289 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $559 million, both largely as a result of a 27% increase in R&D headcount. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $425 million and an increase in professional services of $371 million due to additional expenses incurred for consulting and outsourced services. R&D expenses increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to a higher increase in labor and facilities-related costs relative to the increase in revenues.\nR&D expenses increased $1,054 million from 2012 to 2013 and as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat from 2012 to 2013. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $596 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $367 million, both largely as a result of an 18% increase in R&D headcount.\nWe expect that R&D expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2015 and future periods.\nSales and Marketing\nThe following table presents our sales and marketing expenses, and those expenses as a percentage of revenues, for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of:\n•\nLabor and facilities-related costs for our personnel engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions;\n•\nAdvertising and promotional expenditures related to our products and services; and\n•\nStock-based compensation expense for our employees engaged in sales, sales support, and certain customer service functions.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1,577 million and increased slightly as a percentage of revenues from 2013 to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $614 million. In addition, there was an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $571 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $163 million, both largely resulting from a 15% increase in sales and marketing headcount. Sales and marketing expenses increased slightly as a percentage of revenues primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses relative to the increase in revenues.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1,089 million from 2012 to 2013 and as a percentage of revenues remained flat from 2012 to 2013. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $674 million, as well as an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $233 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $103 million, both largely resulting from a 13% increase in sales and marketing headcount.\nWe expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may increase as a percentage of revenues in 2015 and future periods.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe following table presents our general and administrative expenses, and those expenses as a percentage of revenues, for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of:\n•\nLabor and facilities-related costs for personnel in our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, and legal organizations;\n•\nProfessional services fees primarily related to outside legal, audit, information technology consulting, and outsourcing services;\n•\nAmortization of certain intangible assets; and\n•\nStock-based compensation expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1,419 million and also increased as a percentage of revenues from 2013 to 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $576 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $260 million, both largely resulting from a 24% increase in general and administrative headcount. In addition, there was an increase in professional services related expense of $314 million due to higher legal-related costs, as well as additional consulting and outsourced services. General and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs and stock-based compensation expense relative to the increase in revenues.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $951 million from 2012 to 2013 and as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat from 2012 to 2013. The increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in labor and\nfacilities-related costs of $396 million, largely resulting from a 15% increase in general and administrative headcount, an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expense of $222 million, as well as an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets of $157 million.\nWe expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in 2015 and in future periods.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table presents our aggregate stock-based compensation expense, and stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenues, as reflected in our consolidated results from continuing operations for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nStock-based compensation increased $1,048 million from 2013 to 2014 and increased slightly as a percentage of revenues. These increases were primarily due to an increased headcount to support our growing business. In addition, we granted additional stock awards to our employees throughout 2014.\nStock-based compensation increased $654 million from 2012 to 2013 and as a percentage of consolidated revenues remained flat from 2012 to 2013. This increase in expenses was primarily due to an increase in headcount to support our growing business.\nWe estimate stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $4.3 billion in 2015 and $5.5 billion thereafter related to stock awards outstanding as of December 31, 2014. This estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to stock-based awards granted after December 31, 2014. If forfeiture rates are different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nInterest and Other Income, Net\nThe following table presents the components included in Interest and Other Income, Net, as reflected in our consolidated results from continuing operations for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nInterest and other income, net, increased $267 million from 2013 to 2014. This increase was primarily driven by realized gains on non-marketable equity investments of $159 million and previously-held equity interests of $126 million, as well as a loss recognized on divestiture of businesses (other than Motorola Home) in 2013. These increases were partially offset by an increase in foreign currency exchange loss of $23 million and a decrease in interest income of $20 million.\nInterest and other income, net, decreased $139 million from 2012 to 2013. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in the gain on divestiture of businesses (other than Motorola Home) of $245 million and a decrease in the realized gain on investments of $124 million, partially offset by a decrease in foreign currency exchange loss of $135 million and an increase in interest income of $66 million.\nThe costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities recognized to interest and other income, net, are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts, and the volatility of foreign exchange rates.\nAs we expand our international business, we believe costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program may increase in 2015 and future periods.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for income taxes, and effective tax rate for the periods presented (dollars in millions):\nOur provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate increased from 2013 to 2014, largely due to proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have higher statutory tax rates and more benefit recognized in 2013 relative to 2014 due to the retroactive extension of the 2012 federal research and development credit, offset by a benefit taken on a valuation allowance release related to a capital loss carryforward in 2014.\nOur provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate decreased from 2012 to 2013, primarily as a result of proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates, as well as the federal research and development credit related to the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which was applied in the first quarter of 2013.\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.\nWe are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. Further information on these issues, the treatment of undistributed foreign earnings and a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate can be found in Notes 10 and 14 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional information about our provision for income taxes.\nNet Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations\nMotorola Mobile\nOn October 29, 2014, we closed the sale of the Motorola Mobile business to Lenovo for a total purchase price of approximately $2.9 billion (subject to certain adjustments), including $1.4 billion paid at close, comprised of $660 million in cash and $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares. The remaining $1.5 billion was paid in the form of an interest-free, three-year prepayable promissory note.\nWe maintain ownership of the vast majority of the Motorola Mobile patent portfolio, including pre-closing patent applications and invention disclosures, which we licensed to Motorola Mobile for its continued operations. Additionally, in connection with the sale, we agreed to indemnify Lenovo for certain potential liabilities of the Motorola Mobile business, for which we recorded a liability of $130 million as of December 31, 2014.\nThe sale resulted in a gain of $740 million, net of tax, which was presented as part of net income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014. Incremental to this net gain, we recognized an additional income of $254 million, net of tax, in connection with certain IP licensing arrangements between the parties, included as part of net income from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe financial results of Motorola Mobile through the date of divestiture are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The following table presents financial results of the Motorola Mobile business included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014 (in millions):\n(1) The operating results of Motorola Mobile were included in our Consolidated Statements of Income from January 1, 2014 through October 29, 2014, the date of divestiture.\nMotorola Home\nOn April 17, 2013, we sold the Motorola Home business to Arris.\nThe financial results of Motorola Home through the date of divestiture are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The following table presents financial results of the Motorola Home business included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 (in millions):\n(1) The operating results of Motorola Home were included in our Consolidated Statements of Income from January 1, 2013 through April 17, 2013, the date of divestiture.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year. Please note that previously reported quarters have been adjusted to show discontinued operations for the sale of the Motorola Mobile and Motorola Home businesses. In addition, per share amounts for the previously reported quarters below have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split. Please see Note 1 and Note 12 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Stock Split.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2014. This table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2014:\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nCapital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $64.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, fixed-income bond funds, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the U.S., corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. From time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public, which we generally dispose of when restrictions are lifted.\nAs of December 31, 2014, $38.7 billion of the $64.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. As of December 31, 2014, we had unused letters of credit of approximately $842 million. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. In addition, we may make acquisitions, increase our capital expenditures, or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund these activities. Additional financing may not be available or on terms favorable to us.\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.1% that matures at various dates through April 2015. Average commercial paper borrowings during the year were $2.1 billion and the maximum amount outstanding during the year was $2.4 billion. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving\ncredit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility and no amounts were outstanding.\nIn May 2011, we issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (2011 Notes) in three equal tranches, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2011 Notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. In February 2014, we issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (2014 Notes) due in 2024, which was used to repay $1.0 billion of the first tranche of our 2011 Notes that matured in May 2014 and for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the 2011 and 2014 notes had a total carrying value of $3.0 billion and a total estimated fair value of $3.1 billion. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the notes.\nIn August 2013, we entered into a $258 million capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028 with an option to purchase in 2016. The effective rate of the capital lease obligation approximates the market rate. The estimated fair value of the capital lease obligation approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2014.\nLiquidity\nFor 2012, 2013 and 2014, our cash flows were as follows (in millions):\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by our operations is advertising revenues generated by Google websites and Google Network Members' websites. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of digital content and licensing payments. Prior to its divestiture, we also generated cash from sales of hardware products related to the Motorola Mobile business.\nOur primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our Google Network Members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. Prior to the sale of the Motorola Mobile business, our use of cash also included payment for manufacturing and inventory-related costs in the Motorola Mobile business. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to increased net income adjusted for depreciation and loss on disposal of property and equipment and stock-based compensation expense, and a net increase in cash from changes in working capital primarily driven by changes in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to increased net income adjusted for gain on divestiture of businesses, depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment, stock-based compensation expense, and amortization of intangible assets. These increases were partially offset by the net decrease in cash from changes in working capital primarily as a result of a decrease in income taxes, an increase in accounts receivable and inventories, offset by an increase in accounts payable.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by or used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment, as well as acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and intangible assets. Our cash provided or used in investing activities includes purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities in our investment portfolio and our investments in reverse repurchase agreements and the cash collateral received or returned from our securities lending program.\nCash used in investing activities increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to increases in capital expenditures related to our production equipment, data centers, and real estate purchases, higher spend related to acquisitions, and lower proceeds received in 2014 from divestiture of businesses compared to 2013. This increase was partially offset by a net decrease in purchases of marketable securities.\nCash used in investing activities increased from 2012 to 2013 primarily due to a net increase in purchases of marketable securities and an increase in capital expenditures primarily related to our production equipment, data centers, and real estate purchases. This increase was partially offset by lower spend related to acquisitions and an increase in proceeds received from divestiture of businesses.\nCash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds or payments from issuance or repayments of debt and net proceeds or payments and excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities.\nCash used in financing activities increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily driven by an increase in net payments related to stock-based award activities, offset partially by a decrease in net cash payments related to debt.\nCash used in financing activities increased from 2012 to 2013 primarily driven by an increase in net cash payments related to debt and, to a lesser extent, an increase in net payments for stock-based award activities.\nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2014\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring primarily between 2015 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the related operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the above table. Certain of these leases have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such leases on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases have adjustments for market provisions. In October 2014, we entered into certain non-cancelable office lease agreements with original lease periods expiring between 2027 and 2028 where we will be the deemed owner for accounting purposes of new construction projects. Future minimum lease payments under the leases total approximately $1.0 billion, of which $250 million is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014 as a an asset and corresponding non-current liability, which represents our estimate of construction costs incurred, and the balance of which is included in the schedule above.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations represent non-cancelable contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014. These contracts are primarily related to video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, data center operations and facility build-outs, as well as purchase of inventory.\nLong-term Debt Obligations\nLong-term debt obligations represent principal and interest payments to be made over the life of our unsecured senior notes issued in May 2011 and May 2014, and our capital lease obligation incurred in August 2013. Please see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\nPossible Adjustment Payment to Class C Capital Stockholders\nIn accordance with a settlement of litigation involving the authorization to distribute the Class C capital stock, we may be obligated to make a payment (the Possible Adjustment Payment) to holders of the Class C capital stock if, on a volume-weighted average basis, the Class C capital stock trades below the Class A common stock during the first\n365 days following the first date the Class C shares traded on NASDAQ (the Lookback Period), payable in cash, Class A common stock, Class C capital stock, or a combination thereof, at the discretion of the board of directors. Had we been obligated to make a payment based on the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of the Class A and Class C shares from April 3, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the monetary value of the Possible Adjustment Payment would have been approximately $593 million as of December 31, 2014. Please see Note 12 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to the Possible Adjustment Payment.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities represent cash obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities and consist primarily of payments owed in connection with certain investments and asset retirement obligations.\nIn addition to the amounts above, we had long-term taxes payable of $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2014 related to tax positions for which the timing of the ultimate resolution is uncertain. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2014, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nPlease see Note 1 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the summary of significant accounting policies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nAlthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, indirect taxes, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and a range of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the range of the possible loss in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related ranges of possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology; and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nOther estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more fully discussed in Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. Goodwill impairment tests require judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. As of December 31, 2014, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment, long-term prepayments, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our marketable and non-marketable securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as interest and other income, net.",
         "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the US dollar. We are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. As of December 31, 2014, our most significant currency exposures are the British pound, Euro, and Japanese Yen.\nWe use foreign exchange option contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. We designate these option contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The fair value of the option contract is separated into its intrinsic and time values. Changes in the time value are recorded in interest and other income, net. Changes in the intrinsic value are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20% at December 31, 2013 and 2014, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately $4 million and $686 million lower at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest and other income, net, would have been approximately $123 million and $90 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20% at December 31, 20013 and December 31, 2014, the amount recorded in accumulated AOCI related to our foreign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately $1.7 billion and $2.5 billion higher at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, and the total amount of expense recorded as interest and other income, net, would have been approximately $120 million and $164 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.\nIn addition, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in \"Interest and other income, net,\" which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $52 million and $93 million at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. The adverse impact at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $853 million and $948 million from foreign exchange contracts in place for the months of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements. We invest primarily in fixed rate securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, asset backed securities, municipal securities, time deposits and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, unrealized losses on our marketable debt securities were primarily due to temporary interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to the fixed interest rates on our debt securities. We account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with changes on gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold. We use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge realized gains and losses on our securities. These derivative contracts are accounted for as hedges at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Interest and other income, net.\nWe considered the historical volatility of short-term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our marketable securities of approximately $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, after taking into consideration the offsetting effect from interest rate derivative contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.",

Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 6, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 6, 2015\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Google Inc.\nWe have audited Google Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Google Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn our opinion, Google Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Google Inc. as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 of Google Inc. and our report dated February 6, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 6, 2015\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except share and par value amounts which are reflected in thousands,\nand par value per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(In millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n(In millions, except for share amounts which are reflected in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes.\nGoogle Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1.

We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising.\nOn April 17, 2013, we sold the Motorola Home business (Motorola Home) to Arris Group, Inc. (Arris). The financial results of Motorola Home are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013. See Note 8 for further discussion of the sale.\nOn April 2, 2014, we completed a two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend (the Stock Split). All references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split. See Notes 11 and 12 for additional information about the Stock Split.\nOn October 29, 2014, we sold the Motorola Mobile business (Motorola Mobile) to Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo). The financial results of Motorola Mobile are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014. See Note 8 for further discussion of the sale.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Google Inc. and our subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table presents our revenues by revenue source (in millions):\nWe generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising, and we recognize revenues when the services or products have been provided or delivered, the fees we charge are fixed or determinable, we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions, and collectability is reasonably assured.\nPerformance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Most of our performance advertisers pay us on a cost-per-engagement basis, for example, when a user engages in their ads. Brand advertising enhances users’ awareness of and affinity with advertisers’ products and services, through videos, text, images, and other ads that run across various devices.\nGoogle AdWords is our auction-based advertising program that enables performance advertisers to place text-based and display ads on Google websites and our Google Network Members’ websites. Google AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on our Google Network Members’ websites. Most of our customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user clicks on one of its ads. We also offer advertising on a cost-per-impression basis that enables our brand advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads display on Google websites and our Google Network Members’ websites as specified by the advertisers.\nWe recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results or content on Google websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. For those advertisers using our cost-per-impression pricing, we recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on Google websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. We report our Google AdSense revenues on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisers.\nFor hardware product sales, where we sell directly to end customers or through distribution channels, revenue recognition generally occurs when products have been shipped, risk of loss has transferred to the customer, objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met, no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts, price protection, returns and customer incentives can be reasonably and reliably estimated. Recorded revenues are reduced by these allowances. Where these allowances cannot be reasonably and reliably estimated, we recognize revenue at the time the product sells through the distribution channel to the end customer.\nFor the sale of certain third-party products and services, we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customers or the net amount earned as revenue share. Generally, when we are primarily obligated in a transaction, are subject to inventory risk or have latitude in establishing prices, or have several but not all of these indicators, revenue is recorded on a gross basis. We generally record the net amounts as revenue earned if we are not primarily obligated and do not have inventory risk or latitude in establishing prices. Such amounts earned are typically determined using a fixed percentage, a fixed fee, or a combination of the two.\nFor arrangements that include multiple deliverables, primarily for products that contain software essential to the hardware products’ functionality and services, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, we use a hierarchy to determine the selling prices to be used for allocating revenue: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price, and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable. ESPs reflect our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.\nWe record deferred revenues upon invoicing or when cash payments are received in advance of our performance in the underlying agreement on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of traffic acquisition costs which are the advertising revenues shared with our Google Network Members and the amounts paid to our distribution partners who distribute our browser or otherwise direct search queries to our website.\nAdditionally, other costs of revenues includes the following:\n•\nContent acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (We share most of the fees these sales generate with content providers or pay a fixed fee to these content providers);\n•\nThe expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs);\n•\nInventory costs for hardware we sell;\n•\nStock-based compensation paid to our employees;\n•\nCredit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions; and\n•\nAmortization of certain intangible assets.\nStock-based Compensation\nRestricted stock units (RSUs) are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. Shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number\nof RSUs outstanding. We record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us primarily as a reduction to additional paid-in capital when paid.\nFor stock option awards outstanding in the periods presented, we determined fair value using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model on the dates of grant.\nWe recognize stock-based compensation using the straight-line method over the vesting period.\nWe include as part of cash flows from financing activities the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax-effected compensation of the related stock-based awards for options exercised and RSUs vested during the period. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $736 million, $1,174 million, and $465 million, respectively, and the total direct tax benefit realized, including the excess tax benefit, from stock-based award activities was $747 million, $1,195 million, and $1,356 million, respectively. We have elected to account for the indirect effects of stock-based awards -- primarily the research and development tax credit -- through the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, we recognized stock-based compensation expense from continuing operations and related tax benefits of $2,473 million and $545 million, $3,127 million and $685 million, and $4,175 million and $867 million, respectively. Additionally, net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, includes stock-based compensation expense and related tax benefits of $219 million and $57 million, $216 million and $59 million, and $104 million and $30 million, respectively.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nOur revenues are primarily derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, our revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the world. Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments and municipalities in the U.S., corporate securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, we generated approximately 46%, 45%, and 43% of our revenues from customers based in the U.S., with the majority of customers outside of the U.S. located in Europe and Japan. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend, but generally we do not require collateral from our customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations.\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2012, 2013, or 2014.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial assets and financial liabilities that include cash equivalents, marketable securities, and foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We measure certain other assets including our non-marketable equity securities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Our other current financial assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying value and are therefore not recorded at fair value.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nWe invest our excess cash primarily in time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments and municipalities in the U.S., corporate securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities.\nWe classify all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities.\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable\nsecurities as available-for-sale. We may or may not hold securities with stated maturities greater than 12 months until maturity. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other-than-temporary, which we record within interest and other income, net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of interest and other income, net.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nWe have accounted for non-marketable equity securities either under the equity or cost method. Investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee are accounted for under the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our marketable and non-marketable securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as interest and other income, net.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we normally do not charge interest. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers. We determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. We depreciate buildings over periods up to 25 years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. Depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed to external users, before technological feasibility of such products is reached. We have determined that technological feasibility is reached shortly before the release of those products and as a result, the development costs incurred after the establishment of technological feasibility and before the release of those products are not material.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software programs to be used solely to meet our internal needs and cloud based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition. We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based\non their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nLong-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review property and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. In 2014, we recorded impairments of intangible assets, including an impairment of $378 million in the third quarter of 2014 related to a patent licensing royalty asset.\nWe test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. No goodwill impairment has been identified in any of the years presented.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one to twelve years.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize income taxes under the liability method. We recognize deferred income taxes for differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. We recognize the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end rates of exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end spot rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange losses in interest and other income, net.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $1,992 million, $2,389 million, and $3,004 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn April 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08 (ASU 2014-08) “Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity.\" ASU 2014-08 raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. It is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted but only for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued. We do not expect the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-08 to be material to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09) \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)”, and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 (ASU 2014-10) \"Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation\". ASU 2014-10 removes the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the ASC thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities. The amendment eliminating the exception to the sufficiency-of-equity-at-risk criterion for development stage entities should be applied retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning\nafter December 15, 2015, and interim periods therein. Early application of these amendments is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-10 on our consolidated financial statements.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nReclassifications of prior period amounts related to discontinued operations as a result of the sale of Motorola Home and Motorola Mobile businesses, and share and per share amounts due to the Stock Split have been made to conform to the current period presentation.\nNote 2. Financial Instruments\nFair Value Measurements\nWe measure our cash equivalents, marketable securities, and foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2 because we use quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair value. We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment categories as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 (in millions):\n(1)\nThe majority of our time deposits are foreign deposits.\n(2)\nThe balances as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 were related to cash collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months. See below for further discussion of this program.\n(3)\nFixed-income bond funds consist of mutual funds that primarily invest in corporate and government bonds.\nDuring the second quarter of 2013, we received approximately $175 million in Arris' common stock (10.6 million shares) in connection with the disposition of Motorola Home and during the fourth quarter of 2014, we received $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares (519.1 million shares) in connection with the disposition of Motorola Mobile (see details in Note 8). These shares are accounted for as available-for-sale marketable equity securities.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method. We recognized gross realized gains of $383 million, $416 million, and $238 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014. We recognized gross realized losses of $101 million, $258 million, and $85 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014. We reflect these gains and losses as a component of interest and other income, net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable debt securities, accounted for as available-for-sale securities and classified by the contractual maturity date of the securities (in millions):\nThe following tables present gross unrealized losses and fair values for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):\nWe periodically review our marketable debt and equity securities for other-than-temporary impairment. We consider factors such as the duration, severity and the reason for the decline in value, the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (i) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, and (ii) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, we did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment loss.\nNon-Marketable Equity Investments\nOur non-marketable equity investments are investments we have made in privately-held companies accounted for under the equity or cost method. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, these investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, and those investments accounted for under the cost method had a carrying value of $1.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. For investments accounted for under the cost method, we concluded that their fair values exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. We periodically review our non-marketable equity investments for impairment. No material impairments were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014.\nSecurities Lending Program\nFrom time to time, we enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income. We loan selected securities which are collateralized in the form of cash or securities. Cash collateral is invested in reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized in the form of securities.\nWe classify loaned securities as cash equivalents or marketable securities and record the cash collateral as an asset with a corresponding liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We classify reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months as cash equivalents and those longer than three months as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For security collateral received, we do not record an asset or liability except in the event of counterparty default.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as interest and other income, net, as part of revenues, or as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as discussed below.\nWe enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and our anticipated debt issuance. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $35 million and $268 million.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe use options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $10.0 billion and $13.6 billion as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 36 months or less.\nIn 2012, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1.0 billion and terms calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate, that effectively locked in an interest rate on our anticipated debt issuance of $1.0 billion in 2014. We issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in February 2014 (See details in Note 3). As a result, we terminated the forward-starting interest rate swaps upon the debt issuance. The gain associated with the termination is reported within Operating Activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2014, consistent with the impact of the hedged item.\nWe reflect gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify cumulative gains and losses to revenues or interest expense when the hedged transactions are recorded.\nIf the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI would be immediately reclassified to interest and other income, net. Further, we exclude the change in the time value of the options from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. We record the premium paid or time value of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter, we recognize changes to this time value in interest and other income, net.\nAs of December 31, 2014, the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was $817 million, of which $645 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We exclude changes in the time value for forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The notional principal of these contracts was $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.\nStarting in the quarter ended September 30, 2014, we used interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to hedge interest rate risk for certain fixed rate securities. The notional principal of these contracts was $175 million as of December 31, 2014.\nGains and losses on these forward contracts and interest rate swaps are recognized in interest and other income net along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of forward and option contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in interest and other income, net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts outstanding was $9.4 billion and $6.2 billion as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.\nWe also use exchange-traded interest rate futures contracts and “To Be Announced” (TBA) forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to hedge interest rate risks on certain fixed income securities. The TBA contracts meet the definition of derivative instruments in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. Our interest rate futures and TBA contracts (together interest rate contracts) are not designated as hedging instruments. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs, in interest and other income, net. The gains and losses are generally economically offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of AOCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from AOCI into interest and other income, net. The total notional amounts of interest rate contracts outstanding were $13 million and $150 million as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.\nThe fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):\nThe effect of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships on income and other comprehensive income (OCI) is summarized below (in millions):\n(1)\nGains (losses) related to the ineffective portion of the hedges were not material in all periods presented.\nThe effect of derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationships on income is summarized below (in millions):\n(2)\nLosses related to the amount excluded from effectiveness testing of the hedges were $8 million, $9 million, and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014.\nThe effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on income is summarized below (in millions):\nOffsetting of Derivatives, Securities Lending, and Reverse Repurchase Agreements\nWe present our derivatives, securities lending and reverse repurchase agreements at gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, our master netting and other similar arrangements allow net settlements under certain conditions. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, information related to these offsetting arrangements was as follows (in millions):\n(1) The balances at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 were related to derivative liabilities which are allowed to be net settled against derivative assets in accordance with our master netting agreements.\n(2) The balances at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 included $1,270 million and $1,762 million recorded in cash and cash equivalents, respectively, and $100 million and $875 million recorded in receivable under reverse repurchase agreements, respectively.\n(3) The balances at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014 were related to derivative assets which are allowed to be net settled against derivative liabilities in accordance with our master netting agreements.\nNote 3. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, we had $2.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper recorded as short-term debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.1% for both periods. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility, and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. The estimated fair value of the short-term debt approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.\nLong-Term Debt\nWe issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (the \"2014 Notes\") in February 2014 and $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three tranches (collectively, the \"2011 Notes\") in May 2011. On May 19, 2014, we repaid $1.0 billion on the first tranche of our 2011 Notes upon their maturity. Additionally, we entered into a capital lease obligation in August 2013. The details of these financing arrangements are described in the table below (in millions):\nThe effective interest yields of the Notes due in 2016, 2021, and 2024 were 2.241%, 3.734% and 3.377%, respectively. Interest on the 2011 and 2014 Notes is payable semi-annually. The 2011 and 2014 Notes rank equally with each other and with all of our other senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. We may redeem the 2011 and 2014 Notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the 2011 Notes or the 2014 Notes. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Notes to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2014 Notes for the repayment of the portion of the principal amount of our 2011 Notes which matured on May 19, 2014 and for general corporate purposes. The total estimated fair value of the 2011 and 2014 Notes was approximately $3.1 billion at both December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014. The fair value of the outstanding 2011 and 2014 Notes was determined based on observable market prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nIn August 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028 with an option to purchase the property in 2016. The effective rate of the capital lease obligation approximates the market rate. The estimated fair value of the capital lease obligation approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2014, aggregate future principal payments for long-term debt (including short-term portion of long-term debt) and capital lease obligation were as follows (in millions):\nNote 4. Balance Sheet Components\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following (in millions):\nProperty under capital lease with a cost basis of $258 million was included in land and construction in progress as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014.\nPrepaid Revenue Share, Expenses and Other Assets, Non-Current\nNote Receivable\nIn connection with the sale of our Motorola Mobile business on October 29, 2014 (see Note 8 for additional information), we received an interest-free, three-year prepayable promissory note (the \"Note Receivable\") due October 2017 from Lenovo. The Note Receivable is included in prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets, non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Based on the general market conditions and the credit quality of Lenovo, we discounted the Note Receivable at an effective interest rate of 4.5% as shown in the table below (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2014, we did not recognize any valuation allowance on the Note Receivable.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe components of AOCI, net of tax, were as follows (in millions):\nThe effects on net income of amounts reclassified from AOCI were as follows (in millions):\nNote 5. Acquisitions\n2014 Acquisitions\nNest\nIn February 2014, we completed the acquisition of Nest Labs, Inc. (Nest), a company whose mission is to reinvent devices in the home such as thermostats and smoke alarms. Prior to this transaction, we had an approximately 12% ownership interest in Nest. The acquisition is expected to enhance Google's suite of products and services and allow Nest to continue to innovate upon devices in the home, making them more useful, intuitive, and thoughtful, and to reach more users in more countries.\nOf the total $2.6 billion purchase price and the fair value of our previously held equity interest of $152 million, $51 million was cash acquired, $430 million was attributed to intangible assets, $2.3 billion was attributed to goodwill, and $84 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. The goodwill of $2.3 billion is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nThis transaction is considered a “step acquisition” under GAAP whereby our ownership interest in Nest held before the acquisition was remeasured to fair value at the date of the acquisition. Such fair value was estimated by using discounted cash flow valuation methodologies. Inputs used in the methodologies primarily included projected future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. The gain of $103 million as a result of\nremeasurement is included in interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDropcam\nIn July 2014, Nest completed the acquisition of Dropcam, Inc. (Dropcam), a company that enables consumers and businesses to monitor their homes and offices via video, for approximately $517 million in cash. With Dropcam on board, Nest expects to continue to reinvent products that will help shape the future of the connected home. Of the total purchase price of $517 million, $11 million was cash acquired, $55 million was attributed to intangible assets, $452 million was attributed to goodwill, and $1 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. The goodwill of $452 million is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nSkybox\nIn August 2014, we completed the acquisition of Skybox Imaging, Inc. (Skybox), a satellite imaging company, for approximately $478 million in cash. We expect the acquisition to keep Google Maps accurate with up-to-date imagery and, over time, improve internet access and disaster relief. Of the total purchase price of $478 million, $6 million was cash acquired, $69 million was attributed to intangible assets, $388 million was attributed to goodwill, and $15 million was attributed to net assets acquired. The goodwill of $388 million is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $1,466 million, which includes the fair value of our previously held equity interest of $33 million. In aggregate, $65 million was cash acquired, $405 million was attributed to intangible assets, $1,045 million was attributed to goodwill, and $49 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expanding our expertise in engineering and other functional areas. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $55 million.\nPro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in aggregate.\nFor all acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2014, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 5.1 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 4.5 years, and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 6.9 years.\n2013 Acquisitions\nIn June 2013, we completed our acquisition of Waze Limited (Waze), a provider of a mobile map application which provides turn-by-turn navigation and real-time traffic updates powered by incidents and route information submitted by a community of users, for a total cash consideration of $969 million. The acquisition is expected to enhance our customers' user experience by offering real time traffic information to meet users' daily navigation needs. Of the total purchase price, $841 million was attributed to goodwill and $193 million was attributed to intangible assets, offset by $65 million of other net liabilities assumed. The goodwill of $841 million is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for a total consideration of approximately $489 million, of which $268 million was attributed to intangible assets, $238 million to goodwill, and $17 million to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our expertise in engineering and other functional areas, our technologies, and our product offerings. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $38 million.\nPro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in aggregate.\nFor all acquisitions completed during the year ended December 31, 2013, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 4.8 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 5.5 years, and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 3.5 years.\nNote 6. Collaboration Agreement\nOn September 18, 2013, we announced the formation of Calico, a life science company with a mission to harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls lifespan. Calico's results of operations and statement of financial position are included in our consolidated financial statements. As of December\n31, 2014, Google has contributed $240 million to Calico in exchange for Calico convertible preferred units. As of December 31, 2014, Google has also committed to fund an additional $490 million on an as-needed basis.\nIn September 2014, AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) and Calico announced a research and development collaboration intended to help both companies discover, develop, and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including for neurodegeneration and cancer. As of December 31, 2014, AbbVie and Calico have each contributed $250 million and committed up to an additional $500 million to fund the collaboration pursuant to the agreement. Calico will use its scientific expertise to establish a world-class research and development facility, with a focus on drug discovery and early drug development; and AbbVie will provide scientific and clinical development support and its commercial expertise to bring new discoveries to market. Both companies will share costs and profits equally. AbbVie's contribution has been recorded as a liability on Calico's financial statements, which is reduced and reflected as a reduction to research and development expense as eligible research and development costs are incurred by Calico over the next few years.\nOn January 15, 2015, AbbVie contributed an additional $500 million to Calico which reflects the remainder of its $750 million commitment to Calico.\nNote 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2014 were as follows (in millions):\nOther Intangible Assets\nInformation regarding our purchased intangible assets is as follows (in millions):\nPatents and developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names and other have weighted-average useful lives from the date of purchase of 7.9 years, 6.0 years, and 5.7 years, respectively. Amortization expense relating to our purchased intangible assets was $744 million, $1,011 million, and $1,079 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014.\nAdditionally, we recorded an impairment charge in other cost of revenues of $378 million related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired in connection with the Motorola acquisition, which Google retained subsequent to the sale of Motorola Mobile. The asset was determined to be impaired due to prolonged decreased royalty payments and\nunpaid interest owed and was written down to its fair value. Fair value was determined based on a discounted cash flow method and reflects estimated future cash flows associated with the patent licensing royalty asset at the measurement date and falls within level 3 in fair value hierarchy.\nAs of December 31, 2014, expected amortization expense for our purchased intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter was as follows (in millions):\nNote 8. Discontinued Operations\nMotorola Mobile\nOn October 29, 2014, we closed the sale of the Motorola Mobile business to Lenovo for a total purchase price of approximately $2.9 billion (subject to certain adjustments), including $1.4 billion paid at close, comprised of $660 million in cash and $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares (519.1 million shares). The remaining $1.5 billion was paid in the form of an interest-free, three-year prepayable promissory note.\nWe maintain ownership of the vast majority of the Motorola Mobile patent portfolio, including pre-closing patent applications and invention disclosures, which we licensed to Motorola Mobile for its continued operations. Additionally, in connection with the sale, we agreed to indemnify Lenovo for certain potential liabilities of the Motorola Mobile business, for which we recorded a liability of $130 million as of December 31, 2014.\nThe sale resulted in a gain of $740 million, net of tax, which was presented as part of net income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014. Incremental to this net gain, we recognized an additional income of $254 million, net of tax, in connection with certain IP licensing arrangements between the parties, included as part of net income from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe financial results of Motorola Mobile through the date of divestiture are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The following table presents financial results of the Motorola Mobile business included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 (in millions):\n(1) The operating results of Motorola Mobile were included in our Consolidated Statements of Income from January 1, 2014 through October 29, 2014, the date of divestiture.\nThe following table presents the aggregate carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities divested (in millions):\nMotorola Home\nOn April 17, 2013, we sold the Motorola Home business to Arris for consideration of approximately $2,412 million in cash, including cash of $2,238 million received at the date of close and certain post-close adjustments of $174 million received in the third quarter of 2013, and approximately $175 million in Arris' common stock (10.6 million shares). Subsequent to the transaction, we own approximately 7.8% of the outstanding shares of Arris. Additionally, in connection with the disposition, we agreed to indemnify Arris for potential liability from certain intellectual property infringement litigation, for which we recorded an indemnification liability of $175 million, the majority of which was settled subsequent to the disposition.\nThe disposition resulted in a net gain of $757 million, which was presented as part of net income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe financial results of Motorola Home through the date of divestiture are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The following table presents financial results of the Motorola Home business included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 (in millions):\n(1) The operating results of Motorola Home were included in our Consolidated Statements of Income from January 1, 2013 through April 17, 2013, the date of divestiture.\nThe following table presents the aggregate carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities divested (in millions):\nNote 9. Interest and Other Income, Net\nThe components of interest and other income, net, were as follows (in millions):\n(1) Includes net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to the functional currency, net of those recognized on foreign exchange contracts. We recorded net foreign currency transaction losses of $61 million, $121 million, and $107 million in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively.\n(2) Gain on divestiture of Motorola Home business was included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. Gain on divestiture of Motorola Mobile business was included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNote 10. Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring primarily between 2015 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table below. Certain of these arrangements have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis.\nAs of December 31, 2014, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases, net of sublease income amounts, were as follows over each of the next five years and thereafter (in millions):\nCertain leases have adjustments for market provisions. Amounts in the above table represent our best estimates of future payments to be made under these leases.\nIn October 2014, we entered into certain non-cancelable office lease agreements with original lease periods expiring between 2027 and 2028 where we will be the deemed owner for accounting purposes of new construction projects. Future minimum lease payments under the leases total approximately $1.0 billion of which $250 million is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2014 as an asset and corresponding non-current liability, which represents our estimate of construction costs incurred, and the balance of which is included in the schedule above.\nRent expense under operating leases, including co-location arrangements, was $417 million, $465 million, and $570 million in 2012, 2013, and 2014.\nPurchase Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had $2.7 billion of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, primarily related to video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, data center operations and facility build-outs, as well as certain inventory purchase commitments.\nPossible Adjustment Payment to Class C Capital Stockholders\nIn accordance with a settlement of litigation involving the authorization to distribute the Class C capital stock, we may be obligated to make a payment (the Possible Adjustment Payment) to holders of the Class C capital stock if, on a volume-weighted average basis, the Class C capital stock trades below the Class A common stock during the first 365 days following the first date the Class C shares traded on NASDAQ (the Lookback Period), payable in cash, Class A common stock, Class C capital stock, or a combination thereof, at the discretion of the board of directors. Had we been obligated to make a payment based on the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of the Class A and Class C shares from April 3, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the monetary value of the Possible Adjustment Payment would have been approximately $593 million as of December 31, 2014. Please see Note 12 for additional information related to the Possible Adjustment Payment.\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had unused letters of credit for $842 million.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions in our services and products, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network Members, and lessors with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that\nvalid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. As of December 31, 2014, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. As part of the sale of Motorola Home and Motorola Mobile businesses, we issued indemnifications for certain potential liabilities. Please see Note 8 for additional information.\nLegal Matters\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. We believe we have adequately responded to all of the allegations made against us and continue to cooperate with the EC.\nThe Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia in Argentina, the Competition Commission of India, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission, Brazil's Council for Economic Defense and the Canadian Competition Bureau have also opened investigations into certain of our business practices.\nThe state attorney general from Mississippi issued subpoenas in 2011 and 2012 in an antitrust investigation of our business practices. We have responded to those subpoenas, and we remain willing to cooperate with them if they have any further information requests. In November 2014, the Ohio Attorney General's office informed us that it was closing its antitrust investigation, which began in May 2011, of our business practices. In May 2014, the Texas Attorney General's office informed us that it was closing its antitrust investigation, which began in July 2010, of our business practices.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an ITC action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Since the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.\nOther\nWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition (such as the pending investigation by the EC described above), intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.\nCertain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is possible and a range of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we disclose the range of the possible loss. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related ranges of possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.\nWith respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nTaxes\nWe are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it would result in a further charge to expense.\nPlease see Note 14 for additional information regarding contingencies related to our income taxes.\nNote 11. Net Income Per Share\nWe compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options, restricted stock units, and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Further, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares and Class C capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. The net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation. Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation.\nThe number of shares and per share amounts for the prior periods presented below have been retroactively restated to reflect the Stock Split. Please see Note 1 and Note 12 for additional information on the Stock Split.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):\nNote 12. Stockholders’ Equity\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nOur board of directors has authorized 100,000,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. As of December 31, 2013 and 2014, there were no shares issued or outstanding.\nClass A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur board of directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nStock Split Effected In Form of Stock Dividend\nIn April 2012, our board of directors approved amendments to our certificate of incorporation that created a new class of non-voting capital stock (Class C capital stock). The amendments authorized 3 billion shares of Class C capital stock and also increased the authorized shares of Class A common stock from 6 billion to 9 billion. The amendments are reflected in our Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (New Charter), the adoption of which was approved by stockholders at our 2012 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on June 21, 2012. In January 2014, our board of directors approved a distribution of shares of the Class C capital stock as a dividend to our holders of Class A and Class B common stock (the Stock Split). The Stock Split had a record date of March 27, 2014 and a payment date of April 2, 2014.\nShare and per share amounts disclosed as of December 31, 2014 and for all other comparative periods have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Stock Split. Except as expressly provided in the New Charter, shares of Class C capital stock have the same rights and privileges and rank equally, share ratably and are identical in all other respects to the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock as to all matters including dividend and distribution rights.\nIn accordance with a settlement of litigation involving the authorization to distribute the Class C capital stock, we may be obligated to make a payment (the Possible Adjustment Payment) to holders of the Class C capital stock if, on a volume-weighted average basis, the Class C capital stock trades below the Class A common stock during the first 365 days following the first date the Class C shares traded on NASDAQ (the Lookback Period), payable in cash, Class A common stock, Class C capital stock, or a combination thereof, at the discretion of the board of directors. The amount of the Possible Adjustment Payment is dependent on the percentage difference that develops, if any, between the volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of Class A and Class C shares during the Lookback Period, as supplied by NASDAQ Data-on-Demand. Had we been obligated to make a payment based on the VWAP of the Class A and Class C shares from April 3, 2014 through December 31, 2014, the monetary value of the Possible Adjustment Payment would have been approximately $593 million as of December 31, 2014.\nAt the end of the Lookback Period, the Possible Adjustment Payment, if any, will be allocated to the numerator for calculating net income per share of Class C capital stock from net income available to shareholders and any remaining undistributed earnings will be allocated on a pro rata basis to Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock based on the number of shares used in the per share computation for each class of stock. In addition, the dilutive impact of the Possible Adjustment Payment, if any, is included in the weighted-average effect of dilutive securities for Class C capital stock in the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe par value per share of our shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock remained unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. On the effective date of the Stock Split, a transfer between retained earnings and common stock occurred in an amount equal to the $0.001 par value of the Class C capital stock that was issued.\nStock Plans\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, shares reserved for future grants under the 2004 Stock Plan expired and we began granting awards from the 2012 Stock Plan (“Stock Plan”). Under our Stock Plan, RSUs or stock options may be granted. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our stock at the time the award vests. Incentive and non-qualified stock options, or rights to purchase common stock, are generally granted for a term of 10 years. Options and RSUs granted to participants under the Stock Plan generally vest over four years contingent upon employment or service with us on the vesting date.\nAs of December 31, 2014, there were 17,525,225 shares of stock reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plan.\nStock-Based Activities\nWe estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the BSM option pricing model. Our assumptions about stock price volatility were based exclusively on the implied volatilities of publicly traded options to buy our stock with contractual terms closest to the expected life of options granted to our employees. We estimated the expected term based upon the historical exercise behavior of our employees. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The weighted-average estimated fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 was $97.14 and $107.20, respectively. No options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair values of the stock options granted in the periods presented:\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our options for the year ended December 31, 2014:\n(1) The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the closing stock prices of $530.66 and $526.40 of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock, respectively, on December 31, 2014.\n(2) Options expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nThe total grant date fair value of stock options vested during 2012, 2013, and 2014 was $489 million, $223 million, and $94 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of all options and warrants exercised during 2012, 2013, and 2014 was $827 million, $1,793 million, and $589 million. These amounts do not include the aggregate sales price of options sold under our Transferable Stock Options (TSO) program, which was discontinued as of November 29, 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2014, there was $56 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding employee stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation expense related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2014:\n(1)\nRSUs expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nAs of December 31, 2014, there was $9.7 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. To the extent the actual\nforfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation expense related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nNote 13. 401(k) Plans\nWe have two 401(k) Savings Plans (401(k) Plans) that qualify as deferred salary arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these 401(k) Plans, matching contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’ contributions subject to certain limitations. We contributed approximately $164 million, $202 million, and $259 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014.\nNote 14. Income Taxes\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $6,447 million, $7,044 million, and $7,936 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, and income from foreign operations of $8,021 million, $8,855 million, and $9,323 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014.\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions):\nThe reconciliation of federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):\nA one-year retroactive extension of the research credit from January 1, 2014, through December 31, 2014, was signed into law on December 19, 2014 in accordance with the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014.\nA retroactive extension of the 2012 federal research and development credit was signed into law on January 2, 2013 in accordance with The American Taxpayer Act of 2012. The benefit of $189 million related to the 2012 federal research and development credit is included in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nWe have not provided U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of December 31, 2014, the cumulative amount of earnings upon\nwhich U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $47.4 billion. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2014, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $554 million and $400 million. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2021 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2015. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $734 million that can be carried over indefinitely. We believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the state tax credit will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a full valuation allowance on the state tax credit carryforward. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our foreign tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $82 million, which will start to expire in 2021. We believe it is more likely than not that all of the foreign tax credit will be realized. We will reassess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence supports a need to establish a valuation allowance, then a tax expense will be recorded accordingly.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we fully utilized our federal capital loss carryforwards for income tax purpose. On the other hand, our state capital loss carryforwards for income tax purpose as of December 31, 2014 were $379 million. We also have deferred tax assets for impairment losses that, if recognized, will be capital in nature. We believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets for capital losses and impairment losses will not be realized. Therefore, we have recorded a valuation allowance on both our federal and state deferred tax assets for these items.\nWe will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nIn December 2012, we entered into an agreement with Arris for the sale of the Motorola Home business. A deferred tax asset was established for the book-to-tax basis difference in our investment in the Motorola Home business upon signing the agreement because the basis difference was going to be recognized in the foreseeable future. In April 2013, upon the sale of the Motorola Home business to Arris, our basis difference in the Motorola Home business became a basis difference in Google’s investment in Arris shares received in the sale and was adjusted by the amount of cash received as part of the transaction. Since any future losses to be recognized upon the sale of Arris shares will be capital losses, a valuation allowance was recorded against this deferred tax asset to the extent such deferred tax asset is not covered by capital gain generated during 2014. We will reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2014 (in millions):\nOur total unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were $1,749 million, $2,378 million, and $3,026 million as of December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2013 and 2014, we had accrued $181 million and $215 million in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes.\nWe and our subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities. Although we file U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign tax returns, our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. and Ireland. During the quarter ended December 31, 2007, the IRS completed its examination of our 2003 and 2004 tax years. We have filed an appeal with the IRS for certain issues related to this audit and settlements were reached in 2012 on all but one issue which we plan to litigate in court. As a result we released the related reserves in the quarter ended December 31, 2012. The IRS is currently in examination of our 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years. We expect the examination to be completed within the next 12 months, but we do not anticipate any significant impact to our unrecognized tax benefit balance as of December 31, 2014, related to our 2007, 2008, and 2009 tax years.\nOur 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes, and our 2010 through 2014 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\nWe have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented. While we believe it is more likely than not that our tax position will be sustained, it is reasonably possible that we will have future obligations related to these matters.\nNote 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nSubsequent to the completion of our sale of the Motorola Mobile business on October 29, 2014, we operate as a single operating segment. Our chief operating decision maker reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance.\nRevenues by geography are based on the billing addresses of our customers. The following tables set forth revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area (in millions):\n(1) Includes the long-lived assets from the Motorola Mobile segment as of December 31, 2013.\nNote 16. Subsequent Event\nInvestment in SpaceX\nOn January 20, 2015, we invested $900 million in SpaceX, a space exploration and space transport company, to support continued innovation in the areas of space transport, reusability, and satellite manufacturing. We are currently evaluating the transaction and its impact on our financial statements.",

Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014. Management reviewed the results of its assessment with our Audit Committee. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

         "ITEM 1.\nBUSINESS\nOverview\nAs our founders Larry and Sergey wrote in the original founders letter, \"Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.\" As part of that, they also explained that you could expect us to make \"smaller bets in areas that might seem very speculative or even strange when compared to our current businesses.\" From the start, the company has always strived to do more, and to do important and meaningful things with the resources we have.\nTo help accelerate this, we announced plans in August 2015 to create a new public holding company, called Alphabet. Alphabet is a collection of businesses -- the largest of which, of course, is Google. It also includes businesses that we combine as Other Bets and generally are pretty far afield of our main Internet products such as Verily, Calico, X, Nest, GV, Google Capital and Access/Google Fiber. Our Alphabet structure is about helping businesses within Alphabet prosper through strong leaders and independence.\nAt Google, our innovations in search and advertising have made our website widely used and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. We generate revenues primarily by delivering online advertising that consumers find relevant and that advertisers find cost-effective. Google's core products such as Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Google Play and Gmail each have over one billion monthly active users. And we believe we are just beginning to scratch the surface. Google's vision is to remain a place of incredible creativity and innovation that uses our technical expertise to tackle big problems. Our Other Bets are also making important strides in their industries, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the long term.\nServing Our Users\nIn many ways Google search -- and the clean white page with the blinking cursor -- is a metaphor for how we think about innovation. Imagining the ways things could be -- without constraint -- is the process we use to look for better answers to some of life's everyday problems. It's about starting with the \"What if?\" and then working relentlessly to see if we can find the answer.\nIt's been that way from the beginning; providing ways to access knowledge and information has been core to Google and our products have come a long way in the last decade. We used to show just ten blue links in our results. You had to click through to different websites to get your answers, which took time. Now we are increasingly able to provide direct answers -- even if you're speaking your question using Voice Search -- which makes it quicker, easier and more natural to find what you're looking for.\nOver time, we have added other services that let you access information quickly and easily. What if we could develop a smarter email service with plenty of storage? That's Gmail. What if we could make a simpler, speedier, safer browser? That's Chrome. What if we could provide easy access to movies, books, music and apps, no matter which device you're on? That's Google Play. What if developers could use Google's infrastructure to easily build and scale applications? And what if people could collaborate and get work done from anywhere on any device? That's cloud and apps.\nAs devices proliferate, it's more and more important to ensure that you can navigate effortlessly across them -- that the technology gets out of the way, so you can move through this multi-screen world as easily as possible. It's why we're investing so much in platforms like our Chrome browser, Chrome OS and our Android mobile operating system. Ultimately, we want you to have speedy, secure access to whatever you need, wherever you happen to be, and on whatever device you may be using at the time.\nAds as Answers\nWe asked, what if ads weren't intrusive and annoying? What if we could deliver a relevant ad at just the right time and give people useful commercial information? What if we could provide products that allow for better attribution and measurement across screens so that we show great ads for the right people?\nOur advertising solutions help millions of companies grow their businesses, and we offer a wide range of products across screens and devices. We generate revenues primarily by delivering both performance advertising and brand advertising.\n•\nPerformance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Most of our performance advertisers pay us when a user engages in their ads. Performance advertising lets our advertisers connect with users while driving measurable results.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nFor performance advertisers, AdWords, our primary auction-based advertising program, helps create simple text-based ads that appear on Google websites and the websites of Google Network Members, who use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads alongside their search results and content. In addition, our partners that comprise the Google Network use our AdSense program to deliver relevant ads that generate revenues and enhance the user experience. These programs let both small and large businesses connect with users looking for a specific item, say a pair of shoes or a plane ticket back home. To that end, we continue to invest in our advertising programs and to make significant upgrades, including Estimated Total Conversions, which help advertisers measure the effectiveness of their campaigns in a multi-screen world.\n•\nBrand advertising helps enhance users' awareness of and affinity with advertisers' products and services, through videos, text, images, and other interactive ads that run across various devices. We help brand advertisers deliver digital videos and other types of ads to specific audiences for their brand-building marketing campaigns and in turn, generate revenue by distributing their ads such as the TrueView ads displayed on our YouTube videos.\nWe have built a world-class ad technology platform for brand advertisers, agencies, and publishers to power their digital marketing businesses. We aim to ensure great user experiences by serving the right ads at the right time and by building deep partnerships with brands and agencies. We also seek to improve the measurability of the effectiveness of brand advertising.\nFurthermore, we have invested significantly in programmatic advertising to help advertisers reach users when and where it matters, giving them access to top-tier inventory across screens and formats, as well as the real-time insights that advertisers need to make their buys count.\nWe have allocated substantial resources to stopping bad advertising practices and protecting users on the web. We focus on creating the best advertising experiences for our users and advertisers in many ways, ranging from removing hundreds of millions of bad ads from our systems every year to closely monitoring the sites and apps that show our ads and blacklisting them when necessary to ensure that our ads do not fund bad content.\nBringing the Next 5 Billion Online\nFast search and high-quality ads matter only if you have access to the Internet. Right now, only a fraction of the seven billion people in the world are fortunate enough to be able to get online. That leaves out billions of people. With so much useful and life-changing information available today, it is unfortunate that such a significant portion of the world's population lacks even the most basic Internet connection.\nThose people will be able to learn and start businesses, to grow and prosper in ways they simply could not without an Internet connection. Creating platforms for other people's success is a huge part of who we are. We want the world to join us online and to be greeted with the best possible experience once they get there. Connection is powerful; and we are working hard to make it a reality for everyone. The opportunities to improve lives on a grand scale are endless.\nAnd there are people around the world whose lives we can improve every day by bringing information into their homes, into their schools, and into their pockets -- showing them just how powerful the simple idea of \"getting online\" can be.\nAt Google, we are helping people get online by tailoring hardware and software experiences that suit the needs of emerging markets, primarily through Android and Chrome. We're also making sure our core Google apps are fast and useful, especially for users in areas where speed, size and connectivity are central concerns.\nOther Alphabet companies are pursuing initiatives with similar goals too. That's why we're investing in new projects, like Project Loon. We asked, what if we could use a network of balloons that could fly at the edge of space and provide connectivity in rural and remote areas? Loon has helped students in Brazil and farmers in New Zealand experience the power of an internet connection for the first time. And as the program expands, we hope to bring this to more and more people -- creating opportunities that simply did not exist before for millions of people, all around the world.\nMoonshots\nThe idea of trying new things is reflected in some of our new, ambitious projects both within Google and Other Bets. Everything might not fit into a neat little box. We believe that is exactly how to stay relevant. Many companies get comfortable doing what they have always done, making only incremental changes. This incrementalism leads to irrelevance over time, especially in technology, where change tends to be revolutionary, not evolutionary. People thought we were crazy when we acquired YouTube and Android, and when we launched Chrome. But as those efforts have matured into major platforms for digital video and mobile devices, and a safer, popular browser, respectively, we continue to look towards the future and continue to invest for the long-term.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nWe won't become complacent, relying solely on small tweaks as the years wear on. As we said in the 2004 Founders' IPO Letter, we will not shy away from high-risk, high-reward projects that we believe in because they are the key to our long-term success. We won't stop asking \"What if?\" and then working hard to find the answer.\nAs explained in the letter from our CEO in August 2015, our Alphabet reorganization was implemented to better allow us to structure teams in ways that we believe will produce the fastest, most focused innovation possible for moonshot projects.\nResearch\nWe continue to invest in our existing products and services, including search and advertising, as well as developing new products and services through research and product development. We often release early-stage products. We then use data and user feedback to decide if and how to invest further in those products.\nOur research and development expenses, which includes the vast majority of engineering and technical headcount responsible for research and development, as well as their associated costs, were $7.1 billion, $9.8 billion, and $12.3 billion in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, which included stock-based compensation expense of $1.6 billion, $2.2 billion, and $2.7 billion, respectively. We expect to continue investing in hiring talented employees and building systems to develop new products and services and improve existing ones.\nCompetition\nOur business is characterized by rapid change as well as new and disruptive technologies. We face formidable competition in every aspect of our business, particularly from companies that seek to connect people with online information and provide them with relevant advertising. We face competition from:\n•\nGeneral purpose search engines and information services, such as Yahoo, Microsoft's Bing, Yandex, Baidu, Naver, WebCrawler, and MyWebSearch.\n•\nVertical search engines and e-commerce websites, such as Kayak (travel queries), LinkedIn (job queries), WebMD (health queries), and Amazon and eBay (e-commerce). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n•\nSocial networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. Some users are increasingly relying on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n•\nOther forms of advertising, such as television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards, and yellow pages. Our advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n•\nOther online advertising platforms and networks, including Criteo, AppNexus, and Facebook, that compete for advertisers with AdWords, our primary auction-based advertising program.\n•\nOther operating systems and mobile device companies.\n•\nProviders of online products and services that provide answers, information, and services. A number of our online products and services, including Gmail, YouTube, and Google Docs, compete directly with new and established companies, which offer communication, information, storage and entertainment services, either on a stand-alone basis or integrated into other offerings.\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to rapidly deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace so that we can attract and retain:\n•\nUsers, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, primarily on the basis of the relevance and usefulness of our search results and the features, availability, and ease of use of our products and services.\n•\nAdvertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels.\n•\nContent providers (Google Network Members, the parties who use our advertising programs to deliver relevant ads alongside their search results and content, as well as other content providers for whom we distribute or license content), primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on various intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks service marks, domain names and copyrights. We have also filed patent applications in the U.S. and foreign\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\ncountries covering certain of our technology, and acquired patent assets to supplement our portfolio. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our rights to other parties.\nCulture and Employees\nWe take great pride in our culture. We embrace collaboration and creativity, and encourage the iteration of ideas to address complex technical challenges. Transparency and open dialogue are central to how we work, and we like to ensure that company news reaches our employees first through internal channels.\nDespite our rapid growth, we still cherish our roots as a startup and wherever possible empower employees to act on great ideas regardless of their role or function within the company. We strive to hire great employees, with backgrounds and perspectives as diverse as those of our global users. We work to provide an environment where these talented people can have fulfilling careers addressing some of the biggest challenges in technology and society.\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue investing in hiring talented employees and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees. As of December 31, 2015, we had 61,814 full-time employees: 23,336 in research and development, 19,082 in sales and marketing, 10,944 in operations, and 8,452 in general and administrative functions. Although we have work councils and statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff.\nSeasonality\nOur business is affected by both seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage and traditional retail seasonality. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year.\nInformation about Segments and Geographic Areas\nPlease refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOther Matters\nAs part of the Alphabet reorganization, we expect to convert Google Inc. into a limited liability company.\nAvailable Information\nOur websites are located at www.google.com and www.abc.xyz, and our investor relations website is located at www.abc.xyz/investor. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and our Proxy Statements are available through our investor relations website, free of charge, after we file them with the SEC. We also provide a link to the section of the SEC's website at www.sec.gov that has all of the reports that we file or furnish with the SEC. You may read and copy any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549.

         "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common and capital stock.\nRisks Related to Our Businesses and Industries\nWe face intense competition. If we do not continue to innovate and provide products and services that are useful to users, we may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur businesses are rapidly evolving, intensely competitive, and subject to changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Competing successfully depends heavily on our ability to deliver innovative products and technologies to the marketplace rapidly and, for Google, provide products and services that make our search results and ads relevant and useful for our users. As our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services, including products and services that may be outside of our historical core business.\nWe have many competitors in different industries, including general purpose search engines and information services, vertical search engines and e-commerce websites, social networks, providers of online products and services, other forms of advertising and online advertising platforms and networks, other operating systems, and wireless mobile device companies. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies to emerging start-ups. Established companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users, and they can use their experiences and resources in ways that could affect our competitive position, including by making acquisitions, continuing to invest heavily in research and development, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether or not meritorious), and continuing to compete aggressively for advertisers and websites. Emerging start-ups may be able to innovate and provide products and services faster than we can or may foresee the consumer need for products and services before us.\nOur competitors are constantly developing innovations in search, online advertising, wireless mobile devices, operating systems, and many other web-based products and services. The research and development of new, technologically advanced products is also a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment, as well as the accurate anticipation of technology, market trends, and consumer needs. As a result, we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development, including through acquisitions, in order to enhance our search technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. If we are unable to provide quality products and services, then acceptance rates for our products and services could decline. In addition, these new products and services may present new and difficult technological and legal challenges, and we may be subject to claims if users of these offerings experience service disruptions or failures or other issues. Our operating results would also suffer if our innovations are not responsive to the needs of our users, advertisers, and Google Network Members, are not appropriately timed with market opportunities, or are not effectively brought to market. As technology continues to develop, our competitors may be able to offer user experiences that are, or that are seen to be, substantially similar to or better than ours. This may force us to compete in different ways and expend significant resources in order to remain competitive. If our competitors are more successful than we are in developing compelling products or in attracting and retaining users, advertisers, and content providers, our revenues and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur ongoing investment in new businesses and new products, services, and technologies is inherently risky, and could disrupt our ongoing businesses.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including insufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return of capital on our investments, distraction of management from current operations, and unidentified issues not discovered in our due diligence of such strategies and offerings that could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nMore people are using devices other than desktop computers to access the Internet and accessing new devices to make search queries. If manufacturers and users do not widely adopt versions of our search technology, products, or operating systems developed for these devices, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through devices other than desktop computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers such as netbooks and tablets, video game consoles, and television set-top devices, is increasing dramatically. The functionality and user experience associated with some alternative devices may make the use of our products and services through such devices more difficult (or just different) and the versions of our products and services developed for these devices may not be compelling to users, manufacturers, or distributors of alternative devices. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work or be viewable on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices. In addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via “apps” tailored to particular devices or social media platforms, which could affect our search and advertising business over time. As new devices and platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the problems we may encounter in adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the creation, support, and maintenance of products and services across multiple platforms and devices. If we are unable to attract and retain a substantial number of alternative device manufacturers, distributors, developers, and users to our products and services, or if we are slow to develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms, we will fail to capture the opportunities available as consumers and advertisers transition to a dynamic, multi-screen environment.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from advertising, and reduced spending by advertisers or a loss of partners could seriously harm our business.\nWe generated 90% of total Google segment revenues from advertising in 2015. Many of our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content partners can terminate their contracts with us at any time. Those partners may not continue to do business with us if we do not create more value (such as increased numbers of users or customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, or more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. If we do not provide superior value or deliver advertisements efficiently and competitively, we could see a decrease in revenue and other adverse impacts to our business. Adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on advertising revenues, which could adversely affect our revenues and business.\nIn addition, expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have a material negative impact on the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers to reduce the amounts they spend on advertising, which could adversely affect our revenues and business.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including:\n•\nincreasing competition,\n•\nchanges in property mix, platform mix, and geographical mix\n•\nthe challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels,\n•\nthe evolution of the online advertising market, including the increasing variety of online platforms for advertising, and the other markets in which we participate, and\n•\nthe rate of user adoption of our products, services, and technologies.\nWe believe our margins could experience downward pressure as a result of increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects of our business. For instance, the margin on revenues we generate from our Google Network Members is significantly less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on Google websites. Consequently, our margins will experience downward pressure if a greater percentage of our revenues comes from ads placed on our Google Network Members' websites compared to revenues generated through ads placed on Google websites. Additionally, the margin we earn on revenues generated from our Google Network Members could decrease in the future if we pay an even larger percentage of advertising fees to our Google Network Members.\nAdditionally, our margins could experience downward pressure because the margin on the sale of digital content and apps, advertising revenues from mobile devices and newer advertising formats are generally less than the margin on revenues we generate from advertising on our websites or traditional formats. Further, our margins could be impacted\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nadversely if we spend a proportionately larger amount to promote or distribute certain products or if we invest more heavily in our R&D efforts across the Company (such as our Other Bets businesses) than we have historically.\nWe are subject to increased regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business.\nThe growth of our company and our expansion into a variety of new fields involves a variety of new regulatory issues, and we have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny as we have grown. For instance, several regulatory agencies have sought to review our search and other businesses on potential competition concerns. We continue to cooperate with the European Commission (EC) and other regulatory authorities around the world in investigations they are conducting with respect to our business and its impact on competition. Legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes, or interpret and apply existing laws, in ways that make our products and services less useful to our users, require us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil or criminal liability, or cause us to change our business practices. These changes or increased costs could negatively impact our business and results of operations in material ways.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may result in adverse outcomes.\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. The sale of hardware products also exposes us to the risk of product liability and other litigation involving assertions about product defects, as well as health and safety, hazardous materials usage, and other environmental concerns. In addition, our businesses face intellectual property litigation, as further discussed later, that exposes us to the risk of exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell products and services.\nSuch claims, suits, and government investigations are inherently uncertain and their results cannot be predicted with certainty. Regardless of the outcome, any of these types of legal proceedings can have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a complex, fact-intensive process that requires significant judgment. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in a particular period. These proceedings could also result in reputational harm, criminal sanctions, consent decrees, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, requiring a change in our business practices or product recalls or other field action, or requiring development of non-infringing or otherwise altered products or technologies. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nAcquisitions are an important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital, and these transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:\n•\nDiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges.\n•\nFailure to successfully further develop the acquired business or technology.\n•\nImplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company.\n•\nIntegration of the acquired company's accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions.\n•\nTransition of operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms.\n•\nFailure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis, if at all, from governmental authorities, or conditions placed upon approval, under competition laws which could, among other things, delay or prevent us from completing a transaction, or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of an acquisition or investment.\n•\nIn the case of foreign acquisitions, the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\n•\nCultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention of employees from the businesses we acquire.\n•\nLiability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, privacy issues, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities.\n•\nLitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our past or future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally.\nOur acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization expenses, or impairment of goodwill and/or purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm our financial condition or results. Also, the anticipated benefits or value of our acquisitions or investments may not materialize.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, Google Network Members, and other partners.\nOur strong Google brand has significantly contributed to the success of our business. Maintaining and enhancing the brands of both Google and Other Bets increases our ability to enter new categories and launch new and innovative products that better serve the needs of our users. Our brands may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including, among others, reputational issues and product/technical performance failures. Further, if we fail to maintain and enhance equity in the Google brand, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to remain a technology leader and continue to provide high-quality, innovative products and services that are truly useful and play a meaningful role in people’s everyday lives.\nA variety of new and existing laws could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. New laws and regulations (or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. For example, current and new patent laws such as U.S. patent laws and European patent laws may affect the ability of companies, including us, to protect their innovations and defend against claims of patent infringement. The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future.\nClaims have been, or may be, threatened and filed against us under both U.S. and foreign laws for defamation, invasion of privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, product liability, or other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched and the ads posted by our users, our products and services, or content generated by our users. Furthermore, many of these laws do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by a number of our new businesses, products, services and technologies. In addition, the applicability and scope of these laws, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain. For example, the laws relating to the liability of providers of online services are currently unsettled both within the U.S. and abroad.\nIn addition, other laws that could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business include, among others:\n•\nThe Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which has provisions that limit in the U.S., but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for caching or hosting, or for listing or linking to, third-party websites that include materials that infringe copyrights or other rights, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Any future legislation impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact us.\n•\nCourt decisions such as the ‘right to be forgotten’ ruling issued by the European court, which allows individuals to demand that Google remove search results about them in certain instances, may limit the content we can show to our users.\n•\nVarious U.S. and international laws that restrict the distribution of materials considered harmful to children and impose additional restrictions on the ability of online services to collect information from minors.\n•\nData protection laws passed by many states that require notification to users when there is a security breach for personal data, such as California’s Information Practices Act.\n•\nData localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types of data collected in a particular country be stored and/or processed within that country.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nWe face risks and costs overseas as our products and services are offered in international markets and may be subject to additional regulations. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nWe are, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property or other claims, which are costly to defend, could result in significant damage awards, and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.\nInternet, technology, media, and other companies own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies may continue to seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. As we have grown, the intellectual property rights claims against us have increased and may continue to increase as we develop new products, services, and technologies.\nWe have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against us by filing claims in U.S. and international courts and the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability to sell our products or services in the U.S. or elsewhere if our products or services or those of our customers or suppliers are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claims. Adverse results in any of these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements (if licenses are available at all), or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business.\nFurthermore, in connection with our divestitures, we have agreed, and may in the future agree, to provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities. In addition, many of our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided to us by our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers from covered products.\nRegardless of the merits of the claims, intellectual property claims are often time consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and cause significant diversion of management attention. To the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful, they may have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brand.\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective.\nAlthough we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovations. Moreover, we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. Furthermore, there is always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.\nWe also seek to maintain certain intellectual property as trade secrets. The secrecy could be compromised by outside parties, or by our employees, which could cause us to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets.\nWe also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there is a risk that the word “Google” could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word “search.” If this happens, we could lose protection for this trademark, which could result in other people using the word “Google” to refer to their own products, thus diminishing our brand.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nAny significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.\nWe may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online services or content.\nWe host and provide a wide variety of services and products that enable users to exchange information, advertise products and services, conduct business, and engage in various online activities both domestically and internationally. The law relating to the liability of providers of these online services and products for activities of their users is still somewhat unsettled both within the U.S. and internationally. Claims have been threatened and have been brought against us for defamation, negligence, breaches of contract, copyright or trademark infringement, unfair competition, unlawful activity, tort, including personal injury, fraud, or other theories based on the nature and content of information that we publish or to which we provide links or that may be posted online or generated by us or by third parties, including our users. In addition, we are and have been and may again in the future be subject to domestic or international actions alleging that certain content we have generated or third-party content that we have made available within our services violates U.S. and non-U.S. law.\nWe also arrange for the distribution of third-party advertisements to third-party publishers and advertising networks, and we offer third-party products, services, or content. We may be subject to claims concerning these products, services, or content by virtue of our involvement in marketing, branding, broadcasting, or providing access to them, even if we do not ourselves host, operate, provide, or provide access to these products, services, or content. Defense of any such actions could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resources, may result in monetary liabilities or penalties, and may require us to change our business in an adverse manner.\nPrivacy concerns relating to our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services.\nFrom time to time, concerns have been expressed about whether our products, services, or processes compromise the privacy of users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, as nearly all of our products and services are web-based, the amount of data we store for our users on our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure or compromise of our security that results in the release of our users’ data could seriously limit the adoption of our products and services, as well as harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business. We expect to continue to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches. The risk that these types of events could seriously harm our business is likely to increase as we expand the number of web-based products and services we offer, and operate in more countries.\nRegulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, including measures to ensure that our encryption of users’ data does not hinder law enforcement agencies’ access to that data. In addition, the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection laws in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change our data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nRecent legal developments in Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers of information from Europe to the U.S. A preliminary agreement has been reached between the U.S. and European governments to allow for legal certainty regarding transfers of data. However, given the preliminary nature of the agreement, some uncertainty remains, and compliance obligations could cause us to incur costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.\nIf our security measures are breached, or if our services are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of users to access our products and services, our products and services may be perceived as not being secure, users and customers may curtail or stop using our products and services, and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure.\nOur products and services involve the storage and transmission of users’ and customers’ proprietary information, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, litigation, and potential liability. We experience cyber attacks of varying degrees on a regular basis. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors or vulnerabilities, or otherwise. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, users, or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\ndata or our users’ or customers’ data. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose users and customers.\nWe face a number of manufacturing and supply chain risks that, if not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results and prospects.\nWe face a number of risks related to manufacturing and supply chain management. For instance, the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product, or from the software used in the product. Sometimes, these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers. If the quality of our products does not meet our customers' expectations or our products are found to be defective, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could be negatively impacted.\nWe rely on third parties to manufacture many of our assemblies and finished products, and we have third-party arrangements for the design of some components and parts. Our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms, or if those we engage fail to meet their obligations (whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons), or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of our arrangements with them.\nWe have in the past, and may experience in the future, supply shortages and price increases driven by raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural disasters and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers. Workaround plans to address shortages could entail increased freight costs for expedited shipments. We may experience shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could negatively impact our operations. In addition, some of the components we use in our products are available only from a single source or limited sources, and we may not be able to find replacement vendors on favorable terms or at all in the event of a supply chain disruption.\nAdditionally, because many of our supply contracts have volume-based pricing or minimum purchase requirements, if the volume of our hardware sales decreases or does not reach projected targets, we could face increased materials and manufacturing costs or other financial liabilities that could make our hardware products more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results. Further, certain of our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based on volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supply.\nWe also require our suppliers and business partners to comply with law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but we do not control them or their practices. If any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical, we could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations of or damage to key relationships, and damage to our reputation. If any of them fails to procure necessary license rights to third-party intellectual property, legal action could ensue that could impact the saleability of our products and expose us to financial obligations to third parties.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries (DRC) and procedures pertaining to a manufacturer's efforts regarding the source of such minerals. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers who can supply DRC “conflict free” components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain DRC conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals used in our products.\nWeb spam and content farms could decrease our search quality, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services.\n“Web spam” refers to websites that attempt to violate a search engine's quality guidelines or that otherwise seek to rank higher in search results than a search engine's assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them.\nAlthough English-language web spam in our search results has been significantly reduced, and web spam in most other languages is limited, we expect web spammers will continue to seek ways to improve their rankings inappropriately. We continuously combat web spam, including through indexing technology that makes it harder for spam-like, less useful web content to rank highly. We face challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including “content farms”, which are websites that generate large quantities of low-quality content to help them improve\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\ntheir search rankings. We are continually launching algorithmic changes focused on low-quality websites. If our search results display an increasing number of web spam and content farms, this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information or reduce user traffic to our websites. In addition, as we continue to take actions to improve our search quality and reduce low-quality content, this may in the short run reduce our AdSense revenues, since some of these websites are AdSense partners.\nInterruption or failure of our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability to effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results.\nThe availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial of service attacks, or other attempts to harm our systems. Some of our data centers are located in areas with a high risk of major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism, and to potential disruptions if the operators of certain of these facilities have financial difficulties. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision to close a facility we are using, or other unanticipated problems at our data centers could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors or vulnerabilities, which could result in interruptions in our services or the failure of our systems.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur international operations are significant to our revenues and net income, and we plan to continue to grow internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately 54% of our consolidated revenues in 2015. In certain international markets, we have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed.\nIn addition to risks described elsewhere in this section, our international operations expose us to other risks, including the following:\n•\nChanges in local political, economic, regulatory, tax, social, and labor conditions, which may adversely harm our business.\n•\nRestrictions on foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the U.S.\n•\nImport and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, and customs classifications that may prevent us from offering products or providing services to a particular market and may increase our operating costs.\n•\nLonger payment cycles in some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels of payment fraud.\n•\nStill developing foreign laws and legal systems.\n•\nUncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty as a result of local laws and lack of legal precedent.\n•\nDifferent employee/employer relationships, existence of workers' councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences, making it harder to do business in certain jurisdictions.\nIn addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, privacy and data protection requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and competition regulations, among others. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international growth efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nFinally, since we conduct business in currencies other than U.S. dollars but report our financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Although we hedge a portion of our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Additionally, hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, many outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. Our quarterly, year-to-date, and annual expenses as a percentage of our revenues may differ significantly from our historical or projected rates. Our operating results in future quarters may fall below expectations. Any of these events could cause our stock price to fall. Each of the risk factors listed in this section in addition to the following factors may affect our operating results:\n•\nOur ability to continue to attract users to our websites and retain existing users on our websites.\n•\nOur ability to monetize (or generate revenues from) traffic on Google websites and our Google Network Members' websites both on desktop and mobile devices.\n•\nRevenue fluctuations caused by changes in property mix, platform mix, and geographical mix.\n•\nThe amount of revenues and expenses generated and incurred in currencies other than U.S. dollars, and our ability to manage the resulting risk through our foreign exchange risk management program.\n•\nThe amount and timing of operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related to the maintenance and expansion of our businesses, operations, and infrastructure.\n•\nOur focus on long-term goals over short-term results.\n•\nThe results of our acquisitions and our investments in risky projects, including new businesses, products, services, and technologies.\n•\nOur ability to keep our websites operational at a reasonable cost and without service interruptions.\n•\nOur ability to generate significant revenues from new products and services in which we have invested considerable time and resources.\nBecause our business is changing and evolving, our historical operating results may not be useful to you in predicting our future operating results. In addition, advertising spending has historically been cyclical in nature, reflecting overall economic conditions, as well as budgeting and buying patterns. Also, user traffic tends to be seasonal. Our rapid growth has tended to mask the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced and caused our operating results to fluctuate.\nIf we were to lose the services of Larry, Sergey, Eric, Sundar, or other key personnel, we may not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In particular, Larry Page and Sergey Brin are critical to the overall management of Alphabet and its subsidiaries, and they, along with Sundar Pichai, the Chief Executive Officer of Google, play an important role in the development of our technology. Along with our Executive Chairman Eric E. Schmidt, they also play a key role in maintaining our culture and setting our strategic direction. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, and we do not maintain any key-person life insurance policies. The loss of key personnel could seriously harm our business.\nWe rely on highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, or maintain our corporate culture, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur performance largely depends on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Competition in our industry for qualified employees is intense, and certain of our competitors have directly targeted our employees. In addition, our compensation arrangements, such as our equity award programs, may not always be successful in attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nIn addition, we believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. As our organization grows, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, particularly in light of our holding company reorganization and new operating structure, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet by us and our users. Internet access providers may be able to restrict, block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our users to access the Internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers have taken, or have stated that they may take measures, including legal actions, that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our users to provide our offerings. In addition, in some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject to government-initiated restrictions or blockages. Such interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth.\nNew technologies could block online ads, which would harm our Google business.\nTechnologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of our advertising products. Most of our Google revenues are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages for our users. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our investments.\nGiven the global nature of our business, we have investments both domestically and internationally. Credit ratings and market values of these investments can be negatively impacted by liquidity, credit deterioration or losses, financial results, foreign exchange rates, or other factors. As a result, the value or liquidity of our cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result in a material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items. We are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities. As a result, we have received, and may in the future receive, assessments in multiple jurisdictions on various tax-related assertions, including transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Stock\nThe trading price for our Class A common stock and non-voting Class C capital stock may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading price of our stock has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example, from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, the closing price of our Class A common stock ranged from $497.06 per share to $793.96 per share, and the closing price of our Class C capital stock ranged from $492.55 to $776.60 per share.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock may fluctuate widely in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:\n•\nQuarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\n•\nAnnouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, or capital commitments.\n•\nRecommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates.\n•\nAnnouncements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations, the risk of which is enhanced because it is our policy not to give guidance on earnings.\n•\nAnnouncements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations.\n•\nCommentary by industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other matters affecting our business and results, regardless of its accuracy.\n•\nThe volume of shares of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock available for public sale.\n•\nSales of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock by us or by our stockholders (including sales by our directors, executive officers, and other employees).\n•\nShort sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions on shares of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock.\n•\nThe perceived values of Class A common stock and Class C capital stock relative to one another.\n•\nOur stock repurchase program.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe cannot guarantee that our recently announced stock repurchase program will be fully consummated or that our stock repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value, and stock repurchases could increase the volatility of the price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves.\nIn October 2015, our board of directors authorized our company to repurchase up to $5,099,019,513.59 of our Class C capital stock and in January 2016, our board of directors authorized our Company to repurchase an additional amount of approximately 514 thousand shares. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Although our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program, the share repurchase program does not obligate Alphabet to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The stock repurchase program could affect the price of our stock and increase volatility and may be suspended or terminated at any time, which may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock.\nThe concentration of our stock ownership limits our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, our Class A common stock has one vote per share, and our Class C capital stock has no voting rights. As of December 31, 2015, Larry, Sergey, and Eric beneficially owned approximately 92.5% of our outstanding Class B common stock, which represented approximately 58.5% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Larry, Sergey, and Eric therefore have significant influence over management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets, for the foreseeable future. In addition, because our Class C capital stock carries no voting rights (except as required by applicable law), the issuance of the Class C capital stock, including in future stock-based acquisition transactions and to fund employee equity incentive programs, could prolong the duration of Larry and Sergey’s current relative ownership of our voting power and their ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. Together with Eric, they would also continue to be able to control any required stockholder vote with respect to certain change in control transactions involving Alphabet (including an acquisition of Alphabet by another company).\nThis concentrated control limits or severely restricts our stockholders’ ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock and our Class C capital stock could be adversely affected.\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could discourage a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable.\nProvisions in Alphabet’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for a tri-class capital stock structure. As a result of this structure, Larry, Sergey, and Eric have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, or other change of control transaction that other stockholders may view as beneficial. As noted above, the issuance of the Class C capital stock could have the effect of prolonging the influence of Larry, Sergey, and Eric.\n•\nOur board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.\n•\nOur stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to take certain actions without holding a stockholders' meeting.\n•\nOur certificate of incorporation prohibits cumulative voting in the election of directors. This limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates.\n•\nStockholders must provide advance notice to nominate individuals for election to the board of directors or to propose matters that can be acted upon at a stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer's own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.\n•\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to issue undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain Delaware anti-takeover provisions. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its outstanding voting stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us.\nRisks Related to Our Holding Company Reorganization\nAs a holding company, Alphabet will be dependent on the operations and funds of its subsidiaries.\nOn October 2, 2015, we completed a reorganization pursuant to which Alphabet became a holding company with no business operations of its own. Alphabet’s only significant assets are the outstanding equity interests in Google and any other future subsidiaries of Alphabet. As a result, we rely on cash flows from subsidiaries to meet our obligations, including to service any debt obligations of Alphabet.\nWe may not obtain the anticipated benefits of our reorganization into a holding company structure.\nWe believe that our holding company reorganization and a new operating structure will increase management scale and allow us to focus on running our diverse businesses independently with the goal of maximizing each of the business’ potential. The anticipated benefits of this reorganization may not be obtained if circumstances prevent us from taking advantage of the strategic and business opportunities that we expect it may afford us. As a result, we may incur the costs of a holding company structure without realizing the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nAlphabet’s management is dedicating significant effort to the new operating structure. These efforts may divert management’s focus and resources from Alphabet’s business, corporate initiatives, or strategic opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Additionally, our subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to Alphabet, as the new holding company.",

         "ITEM 7.\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nPlease read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrends in Our Business\nThe following trends have contributed to the results of our consolidated operations, and we anticipate that they will continue to impact our future results:\n•Users' behaviors and advertising continue to shift online as the digital economy evolves.\nThe continuing shift from an offline to online world has contributed to the growth of our business since inception, resulting in increasing revenues, and we expect that this online shift will continue to benefit our business.\n•As online advertising evolves, we continue to expand our product offerings which may impact our monetization.\nAs interactions between users and advertisers change, we continue to expand our product offerings to serve their changing needs. Over time, we expect our monetization trends to fluctuate. For example, we have seen an increase in YouTube engagement ads, which monetize at a lower rate than traditional search desktop ads. Additionally, advertisers are beginning to shift to programmatic buying which presents opportunities for advertisers to connect with the right user, in the right moment, in the right context. This may also have different monetization profiles to our existing advertising business. These trends will continue to affect our monetization in the future.\n•Users are increasingly using multiple devices to access our products and services, and our advertising revenues are increasingly coming from mobile phones and other new formats.\nOur users are accessing the Internet via multiple devices. Mobile computing power continues to grow and users want to feel connected no matter where they are or what they are doing. We seek to expand our products and services to stay in front of this shift in order to maintain and grow our business.\nIn this multi-device world, we generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile phones and newer advertising formats, and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from desktop computers and tablets. Our traffic acquisition cost (TAC) may also be impacted because the rates at which we share mobile revenues with our partners may differ from our traditional desktop and tablet formats. We expect both of these trends to continue to put pressure on our overall margins, particularly if we fail to realize the opportunities presented during the transition to a dynamic multi-screen environment.\n•As users in developing economies increasingly come online, we generate increasing revenues from international markets, and movements in foreign exchange rates impact such revenues.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe shift to online, as well as the advent of the multi-device world, has brought opportunities outside of the U.S., especially in emerging markets, and we continue to develop localized versions of our products and relevant advertising programs useful to our users in these markets. This has led to a trend of increased revenues from international markets over time and we expect that our results will continue to be impacted by our performance in these markets, particularly as low-cost mobile devices become more available.\nOur international revenues represent a significant proportion of our revenues and are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n•The portion of our revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing.\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our Google offerings to our users through products like Google Play, cloud and apps and hardware products. Across these initiatives, we currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of digital content products, hardware sales, service and licensing fees; the margins on these non-advertising businesses vary significantly and may be lower than the margins on our advertising business. A number of our Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, the sources of revenues from these businesses could change over time and the revenues themselves could be volatile.\n•As we continue to look for new ways to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in R&D and our capital expenditures will continue to fluctuate.\nWe continue to make significant research and development (R&D) investments in areas of strategic focus for Google, such as search and advertising, as well as in new products and services across both Google and Other Bets. The amount of our capital expenditures has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the long term as we invest heavily in our systems, data centers, real estate and facilities, and information technology infrastructure.\nIn addition, acquisitions remain an important part of our strategy and use of capital, and we expect to continue to spend cash on acquisitions and other investments. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expanding our expertise in engineering and other functional areas.\n•\nOur employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. Their energy and talent drive Alphabet and create our success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees and to provide competitive compensation programs to our employees. As of December 31, 2015, we had 61,814 full-time employees: 23,336 in research and development, 19,082 in sales and marketing, 10,944 in operations, and 8,452 in general and administrative, an increase of 8,214 total headcount from December 31, 2014.\nExecutive Overview of Results\nHere are our key financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (consolidated unless otherwise noted):\n•\nRevenues of $75.0 billion and revenue growth of 14% year over year, constant currency revenue growth of 20% year over year.\n•\nGoogle segment revenues of $74.5 billion with revenue growth of 14% and Other Bets revenues of $0.4 billion.\n•\nRevenues from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Rest of World were $34.8 billion, $7.1 billion, and $33.1 billion, respectively.\n•\nCost of revenues was $28.2 billion, consisting of traffic acquisition costs of $14.4 billion and other cost of revenues of $13.8 billion. Our traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was 21%.\n•\nOperating expenses (excluding cost of revenues) were $27.5 billion.\n•\nIncome from operations was $19.4 billion.\n•\nEffective tax rate of 17%.\n•\nNet income was $16.3 billion with diluted net income per share for Class A and B common stock of $22.84 and for Class C capital stock of $24.34.\n•\nOperating cash flow was $26.0 billion.\n•\nCapital expenditures were $9.9 billion.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\n•\nHeadcount was 61,814 as of December 31, 2015.\nInformation about Segments\nIn conjunction with the Alphabet reorganization, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we implemented legal and operational changes in how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) manages our businesses, including resource allocation and performance assessment. Consequently, we have multiple operating segments, representing the individual businesses that are run separately under the Alphabet structure.\nGoogle is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the operating segments are combined and disclosed below as Other Bets. All prior-period amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the reportable segment change.\nOur reported segments are described below:\n•\nGoogle - Google includes our main internet products such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome, Google Play as well as hardware products we sell, such as Chromecast, Chromebooks and Nexus. Our technical infrastructure and newer efforts like Virtual Reality are also included in Google.\n•\nOther Bets - Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes businesses such as Access/Google Fiber, Calico, Nest, Verily, GV, Google Capital, X, and other initiatives.\nPlease refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table presents our operating results as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented:\n(1)\nFinancial results of Motorola Home were included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. Financial results of Motorola Mobile were included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014.\n(2)\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities, and as a consequence, we revised our income tax expense for periods beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015. Please refer to Note 1 and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nConsolidated Revenues\nThe following table presents our consolidated revenues, by segment and revenue source (in millions), for the periods presented:\n(1)\nPrior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the reclassification primarily related to DoubleClick ad serving software revenues from Google other revenues to Advertising Revenues from Google Network Members' websites to conform with the current period presentation.\nGoogle segment\nThe following table presents our Google segment revenues (in millions), those revenues expressed as a percentage of consolidated revenues, and changes in our aggregate paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage) for the periods presented:\nUse of Monetization Metrics\nWhen assessing our advertising revenue performance, we present information regarding the number of \"paid clicks\" and \"cost-per-click\" for our Google websites and Google Network Members websites. Management views these as important metrics for understanding our business. We periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity.\nPaid clicks for our Google websites represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by end-users related to searches on Google.com, clicks related to advertisements on other owned and operated properties including Gmail, Finance, Maps, and Google Play; and viewed YouTube engagement ads like TrueView (counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad). Paid clicks for our Google Network Members' websites include clicks by end-users related to advertisements served on Google Network Members' properties participating in our AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content and AdMob businesses. In some cases, such as programmatic and reservation based advertising buying, we charge advertisers by impression; while growing, this represents a small part of our revenue base.\nCost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenue divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the average cost of each engagement by users we charge advertisers.\nThe rate of change in revenue and revenue growth, as well as the rate of change in paid clicks and cost-per-click on Google websites and Google Network Members' websites and their correlation with the rate of change in revenues, has fluctuated and may fluctuate in the future because of various factors, including:\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\n•\ngrowth rates of our revenues from Google websites, including YouTube, compared to those of our revenues from Google Network Members' websites;\n•\nadvertiser competition for keywords;\n•\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nseasonality;\n•\nthe fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;\n•\nchanges in advertising quality or formats;\n•\ntraffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals and channels;\n•\na shift in the proportion of non-click based revenue generated in Google websites and Google Network Members' websites, including an increase in programmatic and reservation based advertising buying; and\n•\ngeneral economic conditions.\nOur revenue growth rate has generally declined over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition, query growth rates, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, the evolution of the online advertising market, our investments in new business strategies, changes in our product mix, and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. We also expect that our revenue growth rate will continue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are delivered on diverse devices, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and movements in foreign currency exchange rates.\nGoogle websites\nThe following table presents our Google websites revenues (in millions), those revenues expressed as a percentage of Google segment revenues, and changes in our paid clicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage) for the periods presented:\nGoogle websites revenues consist primarily of:\n•\nAdWords revenue that is generated on Google.com. This includes revenue from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.;\n•\nAdvertising revenue generated on YouTube, including, but not limited to YouTube TrueView and Google Preferred; and\n•\nAdvertising revenue generated from other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Finance, Maps, and Google Play.\nOur Google websites revenues increased $7,272 million from 2014 to 2015 and also increased as a percentage of Google segment revenues. Our Google websites revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search due to ongoing improvements in ad formats, as well as growth in YouTube video advertising across TrueView and Google Preferred, partially offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\nThe number of paid clicks through our advertising programs increased from 2014 to 2015 due to an increase in aggregate traffic on Google owned properties, the adoption of advertising formats such as YouTube engagement ads, and continued global expansion of our products, advertisers and user base across all platforms, particularly mobile. The positive impact on our revenues from paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The decrease was primarily driven by continued growth in YouTube engagement ads where cost-per-click remains lower than on our other platforms, as well as changes in property and device mix, product mix, geographic mix, and ongoing product changes, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\nOur Google websites revenues increased $7,663 million from 2013 to 2014 and also increased as a percentage of Google segment revenues. Our Google websites revenue growth was driven primarily by growth across all platforms due to ongoing improvements in ad formats, as well as growth in YouTube engagement ads, partially offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe increase in the number of paid clicks generated through our advertising programs from 2013 to 2014 was due to certain monetization improvements including new and richer ad formats, an increase in aggregate traffic across all platforms, the continued global expansion of our products, advertisers, and user base, partially offset by certain advertising policy changes. The positive impact on our revenues from paid clicks was partially offset by a decrease in the average cost-per-click paid by our advertisers. The decrease was due to various factors, such as the geographic mix, device mix, property mix, ongoing product and policy changes, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\nGoogle Network Members' websites\nThe following table presents our Google Network Members' websites revenues (in millions), those revenues expressed as a percentage of Google segment revenues, and changes in our paid clicks and cost-per-click for the periods presented (in percentage terms):\n(1)\nPrior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the reclassification primarily related to DoubleClick ad serving software revenues from Google other revenues to Advertising Revenues from Google Network Members' websites to conform with the current period presentation.\nGoogle Network Members' websites revenues consist primarily of:\n•\nAdSense (such as AdSense for Search, AdSense for Content, etc.);\n•\nAdExchange;\n•\nAdMob;\n•\nAll DoubleClick-related revenues including DoubleClick Bid Manager revenues; and\n•\nOther Network products including AdSense for Domains.\nOur Google Network Members' websites revenues increased $494 million from 2014 to 2015. The increase was primarily driven by strength in programmatic advertising buying, offset by our continued AdSense advertising policy changes aimed at enriching the experience for users and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies. The decrease in Network Members' websites revenues as a percentage of Google segment revenues is due to relatively slower growth of Network Members' websites revenues compared to that of Google websites revenues as well as Google other revenues.\nThe decreases in both paid clicks and cost-per-click paid by our advertisers from 2014 to 2015 were primarily driven by ongoing product and policy changes designed to reduce lower quality inventory on AdSense for Search, changes in property and device mix, product mix, and geographic mix, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\nOur Google Network Members' websites revenues increased $889 million from 2013 to 2014. The increase was mainly due to certain monetization improvements including new and richer ad formats and an increase in the number of Google Network Members, partially offset by certain AdSense advertising policy changes aimed at enriching the experience for users. The decrease in Network Members' websites revenues as a percentage of Google segment revenues is due to relatively slower growth of Network Members' websites revenues compared to that of Google websites revenues as well as Google other revenues.\nThe increase in paid clicks from 2013 to 2014 was due to certain monetization improvements including new and richer ad formats, an increase in aggregate traffic across all platforms, the continued global expansion of our products, advertisers, and user base, and an increase in the number of Google Network Members, partially offset by certain advertising policy changes. The decrease in the average cost-per-click from 2013 to 2014 was due to various factors, such as the geographic mix, device mix, property mix, ongoing product and policy changes, and the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nGoogle other revenues\nThe following table presents our Google other revenues (in millions), and those revenues expressed as a percentage of Google segment revenues, for the periods presented:\n(1)\nPrior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the reclassification primarily related to DoubleClick ad serving software revenues from Google other revenues to Advertising Revenues from Google Network Members' websites to conform with the current period presentation.\nGoogle other revenues consist primarily of:\n•Sales of apps and media content in the Google Play store;\n•\nSales of certain Google branded hardware, such as Chromecast;\n•Service fees received for cloud and apps and our Maps API; and\n•Licensing-related revenue.\nGoogle other revenues increased $1,101 million from 2014 to 2015 and increased as a percentage of Google segment revenues. These increases were primarily due to the growth of our sales of digital content products in the Google Play store, primarily apps (revenues which we recognize net of payout to partners). In addition, there was an increase in revenues from service fees received for cloud and apps offerings. These increases were partially offset by the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies.\nGoogle other revenues increased $1,615 million from 2013 to 2014 and increased as a percentage of Google segment revenues. The increase was primarily due to growth of our sales of digital content products in the Google Play store, primarily apps.\nOther Bets\nThe following table presents our Other Bets revenues (in millions), and those revenues expressed as a percentage of consolidated revenues, for the periods presented:\nOther Bets revenues consist primarily of:\n•\nSales of Nest branded hardware;\n•\nRevenues from internet and TV services; and\n•\nRevenues from licensing and R&D services.\nOur Other Bets revenues increased $121 million from 2014 to 2015 and remained relatively flat as a percentage of consolidated revenues. The increase was primarily due to increases in revenues from sales of Nest branded hardware and revenues from internet and TV services, partially offset by a decrease in licensing revenues. As Nest was acquired in February 2014, the increase in our Nest revenues is impacted by a partial year of revenues in 2014 as compared to a full year in 2015.\nOur Other Bets revenues increased $315 million from 2013 to 2014 and increased as a percentage of consolidated revenues. This is primarily due to the acquisition of Nest in 2014 as well as an increase of licensing revenues.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nConsolidated Revenues by Geography\nThe following table presents our domestic and international revenues as a percentage of consolidated revenues, determined based on the billing addresses of our customers:\nFor the amounts of revenues by geography, please refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUse of Constant Currency and Constant Currency Growth\nThe impact of exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period comparisons. Our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign currencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they exclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-year basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging gains realized in the current period.\nConstant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in current period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated using prior period exchange rates and hedging benefits are excluded from revenues of both periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents our foreign exchange impact on United Kingdom revenues for the periods presented (in millions; unaudited):\nIn 2015, our revenues from the United Kingdom were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates over the prior year, primarily as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the British pound.\nIn 2014, our revenues from the United Kingdom were favorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates over the prior year, primarily as the U.S. dollar weakened relative to the British pound.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe following table presents our foreign exchange impact on Rest of the world and total revenues for the periods presented (in millions; unaudited):\n(1)\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities. We revised the classification of such revenues between Rest of the world and U.S. for prior periods. Please refer to Note 1 and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual report t on Form 10-K for further information.\nIn 2015, our revenues from the Rest of the world (excluding the United Kingdom) were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily because the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the Euro, Brazilian real, Australian dollar and Japanese yen.\nIn 2014, our revenues from the Rest of the world (excluding the United Kingdom) were unfavorably impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to certain currencies, most notably the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar, and partially offset by the favorable impact of the U.S. dollar weakening against certain currencies, most notably the Euro.\nConsolidated Costs and Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists primarily of traffic acquisition costs which are the advertising revenues shared with our Google Network Members and the amounts paid to our distribution partners who distribute our browser or otherwise direct search queries to our website.\nAdditionally, other cost of revenues (which is the cost of revenues excluding traffic acquisition costs) includes the following:\n•\nThe expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs);\n•\nContent acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we share the fees these sales generate with content providers or pay a fixed fee to these content providers);\n•\nCredit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions;\n•\nStock-based compensation expense;\n•\nRevenue share payments to mobile carriers;\n•\nInventory costs for hardware we sell; and\n•\nAmortization of certain intangible assets.\nThe following tables present our cost of revenues and cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues, and our traffic acquisition costs and traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues, for the periods presented (in millions):\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe cost of revenues that we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed through our AdSense program on the websites of our Google Network Members are significantly higher than the costs of revenues we incur related to revenues generated from ads placed on Google websites because most of the advertiser fees from ads served on Google Network Members’ websites are shared with our Google Network Members. For the past five years, growth in advertising revenues from Google websites has generally exceeded that from our Google Network Members’ websites. This had a positive impact on our income from operations during this period.\nCost of revenues increased $2,473 million from 2014 to 2015. The increase was primarily due to data center costs and an increase in content acquisition costs as a result of increased activities related to YouTube and digital content. The remaining increase was driven by increases in traffic acquisition costs of $846 million, resulting from more advertiser fees generated through our AdSense program driven primarily by an increase in advertising revenues, as well as more fees paid to our distribution partners for additional traffic directed to our websites. Additionally, there was an impairment charge of $378 million recognized in 2014 related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired in connection with the Motorola acquisition that did not recur in 2015. The decrease in aggregate traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily a result of a shift of mix from Google Network Members' websites revenue to Google websites revenue.\nCost of revenues increased $3,698 million from 2013 to 2014. The increase was partially due to increases in traffic acquisition costs of $1,239 million resulting from more distribution fees paid for additional traffic directed to Google websites, as well as more advertiser fees paid to Google Network Members, driven primarily by an increase in advertising revenues. The remaining increase was primarily driven by an increase in data center costs, content acquisition costs as a result of increased usage activities related to YouTube and digital content by our users, and revenue share payments to mobile carriers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). In addition, the increase was also driven by the impairment charge described above. The decrease in traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was primarily a result of a shift of mix between Google websites revenue and Google Network Members' websites revenue.\nWe expect cost of revenues will increase in dollar amount and fluctuate as a percentage of total revenues in 2016 and future periods, based on a number of factors, including the following:\n•\nThe relative growth rates of revenues from Google websites and from our Google Network Members' website;\n•\nThe growth rates of expenses associated with our data center operations, as well as our hardware inventory costs;\n•\nIncreased proportion of other non-advertising revenues as part of our total revenues;\n•\nWhether we are able to enter into more revenue share arrangements with Google Network Members and distribution partners that provide for lower revenue share obligations or whether increased competition for arrangements with existing and potential Google Network Members and distribution partners results in less favorable revenue share arrangements;\n•\nWhether we are able to continue to improve the monetization of traffic on Google websites and our Google Network Members' websites; and\n•\nThe relative growth rates of expenses associated with distribution arrangements and the related revenues generated.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nResearch and Development\nThe following table presents our R&D expenses, and those expenses as a percentage of revenues, for the periods presented (in millions):\nR&D expenses consist primarily of:\n•\nLabor and facilities-related costs for employees responsible for R&D of our existing and new products and services;\n•\nDepreciation and equipment-related expenses; and\n•\nStock-based compensation expense.\nR&D expenses increased $2,450 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from 2014 to 2015. These increases were primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $1,502 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $487 million, both largely as a result of a 16% increase in R&D headcount. The increase in labor and facilities-related costs was also impacted by expenses resulting from project milestones in Other Bets established several years ago. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of approximately $248 million and an increase in professional services of $174 million due to additional expenses incurred for consulting and outsourced services.\nR&D expenses increased $2,695 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from 2013 to 2014. These increases were primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $1,289 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $559 million, both largely as a result of a 27% increase in R&D headcount. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $425 million and an increase in professional services of $371 million due to additional expenses incurred for consulting and outsourced services.\nWe expect that R&D expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in 2016 and future periods.\nSales and Marketing\nThe following table presents our sales and marketing expenses, and those expenses as a percentage of revenues, for the periods presented (in millions):\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of:\n•\nLabor and facilities-related costs for our personnel engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain customer service functions;\n•\nAdvertising and promotional expenditures related to our products and services; and\n•\nStock-based compensation expense.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $916 million and remained relatively flat as a percentage of revenues from 2014 to 2015. The increase in dollar amount was primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $329 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $184 million, largely resulting from a 12% increase in sales and marketing headcount. In addition, there was an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $184 million and an increase in professional service fees of $158 million due to additional expenses incurred for consulting and outsourced services.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1,577 million from 2013 to 2014 and increased as a percentage of revenues from 2013 to 2014. These increases were primarily due to an increase in advertising and promotional expenses of $614 million. In addition, there was an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $571 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $163 million, both largely resulting from a 15% increase in sales and marketing headcount.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nWe expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in 2016 and future periods.\nGeneral and Administrative\nThe following table presents our general and administrative expenses, and those expenses as a percentage of revenues, for the periods presented (in millions):\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of:\n•\nLabor and facilities-related costs for personnel in our facilities, finance, human resources, information technology, and legal organizations;\n•\nDepreciation and equipment-related expenses;\n•\nProfessional services fees primarily related to outside legal, audit, information technology consulting, and outsourcing services;\n•\nAmortization of certain intangible assets; and\n•\nStock-based compensation expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $285 million and decreased as a percentage of revenues from 2014 to 2015. The increase in dollar amount was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $136 million and an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $69 million, both largely resulting from a 15% increase in general and administrative headcount. In addition, there was an increase in depreciation and equipment-related expenses of $121 million and an increase of $80 million of miscellaneous general and administrative expenses. These factors were partially offset by a decrease in professional service fees and expenses of $128 million, primarily due to lower legal-related costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $1,419 million and increased as a percentage of revenues from 2013 to 2014. The increases were primarily due to an increase in labor and facilities-related costs of $576 million and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $260 million, both largely resulting from a 24% increase in general and administrative headcount. In addition, there was an increase in professional services related expense of $314 million due to higher legal related costs, as well as additional consulting and outsourced services.\nWe expect general and administrative expenses will increase in dollar amount and may fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in 2016 and future periods.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table presents our equity settled stock-based compensation expense, and equity settled stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenues, as reflected in our consolidated results from continuing operations for the periods presented (in millions):\nStock-based compensation related to equity settled awards increased $1,028 million from 2014 to 2015 and $1,048 million from 2013 to 2014, and increased as a percentage of revenues in both periods. These increases were primarily driven by headcount growth. Additionally, we recognized stock-based compensation expense associated with awards ultimately settled in cash of $0 million, $0 million, and $50 million in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively.\nWe estimate equity settled stock-based compensation expense to be approximately $5.3 billion in 2016 and $5.8 billion thereafter related to stock awards outstanding as of December 31, 2015. This estimate does not include expenses to be recognized related to stock-based awards granted after December 31, 2015. If forfeiture rates are different from what we have anticipated, stock-based compensation related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nConsolidated Other Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table presents other income (expense), net, and other income (expense), net, as a percentage of revenues (in millions):\nOther income (expense), net, decreased $472 million from 2014 to 2015. This decrease was primarily related to a writedown of securities received in conjunction with the sale of a business, as well as, reduced gains on non-marketable investments as compared to 2014. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in interest income as a result of increased cash and fixed income investments.\nOther income (expense), net, increased $267 million from 2013 to 2014. This increase was primarily driven by realized gains on non-marketable equity investments of $159 million and previously-held equity interests of $126 million, as well as a loss recognized on divestiture of businesses (other than Motorola Home) in 2013. These increases were partially offset by an increase in foreign currency exchange loss of $23 million and a decrease in interest income of $20 million.\nThe costs of our foreign exchange hedging activities recognized to other income, net, are primarily a function of the notional amount of the option and forward contracts and their related duration, the movement of the foreign exchange rates relative to the strike prices of the contracts, and the volatility of foreign exchange rates.\nAs we expand our international business, costs related to hedging activities under our foreign exchange risk management program may increase in 2016 and future periods.\nConsolidated Provision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for income taxes, and effective tax rate for the periods presented (in millions):\n(1)\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities, and as a consequence, we revised our income tax expense for periods beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015. Please refer to Note 1 and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate decreased from 2014 to 2015, largely due to a discrete benefit recognized in 2015 as a result of the resolution of a multi-year audit in the U.S. and proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have lower statutory tax rates.\nOur provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate increased from 2013 to 2014, largely due to proportionately more earnings realized in countries that have higher statutory tax rates and more benefit recognized in 2013 relative to 2014 due to the retroactive extension of the 2012 federal research and development credit, offset by a benefit taken on a valuation allowance release related to a capital loss carryforward in 2014.\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate is set forth in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates, the net gains and losses recognized by legal entities on certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles, as well as certain discrete items.\nWe are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nin various taxing jurisdictions. Further information on these issues, the treatment of undistributed foreign earnings and a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate can be found in Notes 11 and 15 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSee Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional information about our provision for income taxes.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables presenting our quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2015. This table includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider necessary for fair presentation of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Both seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and traditional retail seasonality have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our business. Internet usage generally slows during the summer months, and commercial queries typically increase significantly in the fourth quarter of each year. These seasonal trends have caused, and will likely continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.\n(1)\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities, and as a consequence, we revised our income tax expense for periods beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015. Please refer to Note 1 and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe basic and diluted income per share data as included on the consolidated statements of income of Alphabet Inc. were as follows for the periods presented (not required for Google pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a)):\n(1)\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities, and as a consequence, we revised our income tax expense for periods beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015. Please refer to Note 1 and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe following table presents our unaudited quarterly results of operations as a percentage of revenues for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2015:\n(1)\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities, and as a consequence, we revised our income tax expense for periods beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015. Please refer to Note 1 and Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $73.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, fixed-income bond funds, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt instruments issued by municipalities in the U.S., corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. From time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or strategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public.\nAs of December 31, 2015, $42.9 billion of the $73.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flow that we generate from our operations. As of December 31, 2015, we had unused letters of credit of approximately $752 million. We believe that our sources of funding will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our liquidity could be negatively affected by a decrease in demand for our products and services. In addition, we may make acquisitions, increase our capital expenditures, or license products and technologies complementary to our business and may need to raise additional capital through future\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\ndebt or equity financing to provide for greater flexibility to fund these activities. Additional financing may not be available or on terms favorable to us.\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2015, we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding recorded as short-term debt, with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.2% that matures at various dates through February 2016. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility and no amounts were outstanding.\nWe intend to align our capital structure so that debt is held at the holding company level. In January 2016, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to issue up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper from time to time and to enter into a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility to replace Google's existing $3.0 billion revolving credit facility.\nIn May 2011, we issued $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (2011 Notes) in three equal tranches, due in 2014, 2016, and 2021. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2011 Notes were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. In February 2014, we issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (2014 Notes) due in 2024, which was used to repay $1.0 billion of the first tranche of our 2011 Notes that matured in May 2014 and for general corporate purposes.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the outstanding notes had a total carrying value of $3.0 billion and a total estimated fair value of $3.1 billion. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the notes.\nIn August 2013, we entered into a $258 million capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028. We intend to exercise the option to purchase the property in 2016. The effective rate of the capital lease obligation approximates the market rate.\nIn October 2015, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $5,099,019,513.59 of its Class C capital stock, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2015, Alphabet repurchased and subsequently retired $1.8 billion of its Class C capital stock. Alphabet's share repurchases in the year ended December 31, 2015 were funded by Google via a return of capital to Alphabet. In January 2016, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase an additional amount of approximately 514 thousand shares.\nFor 2013, 2014 and 2015, our cash flows were as follows (in millions):\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nOur largest source of cash provided by our operations is advertising revenues generated by Google websites and Google Network Members' websites. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps and digital content, hardware products, licensing arrangements, and service fees received for cloud and apps and our Maps API. Prior to its divestiture in October 2014, we also generated cash from sales of hardware products related to the Motorola Mobile business.\nOur primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to our Google Network Members and distribution partners, and payments for content acquisition costs. Prior to the sale of the Motorola Mobile business, our use of cash also included payment for manufacturing and inventory-related costs in the Motorola Mobile business. In addition, uses of cash from operating activities include compensation and related costs, other general corporate expenditures, and income taxes.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to increased net income adjusted for depreciation and stock-based compensation expense, and loss on sales of marketable and non-marketable securities. This is partially offset by a net decrease in cash from changes in working capital.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to increased net income adjusted for depreciation and loss on disposal of property and equipment and stock-based compensation expense, and a net increase in cash from changes in working capital primarily driven by changes in prepaid revenue share, expenses, and other assets.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\nCash provided by or used in investing activities primarily consists of purchases of property and equipment, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities in our investment portfolio, investments in reverse repurchase agreements and the cash collateral received or returned from our securities lending program, as well as acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and intangible assets.\nCash used in investing activities increased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to net increases in purchases of marketable securities, activities related to security lending and purchases of non-marketable investments. This increase was partially offset by lower spend related to acquisitions, lower investments in reverse repurchase agreements, and a decrease in capital expenditures related to our production equipment, data centers, and real estate purchases.\nCash used in investing activities increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to increases in capital expenditures related to our production equipment, data centers, and real estate purchases, higher spend related to acquisitions, and lower proceeds received in 2014 from divestiture of businesses compared to 2013. This increase was partially offset by a net decrease in purchases of marketable securities.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\nCash used in financing activities consists primarily of net proceeds or payments from issuance or repayments of debt, repurchases of capital stock, and net proceeds or payments and excess tax benefits from stock-based award activities.\nIn Alphabet, cash used in financing activities increased from 2014 to 2015 primarily driven by the repurchases of capital stock and an increase in net payments related to stock-based award activities. In Google, cash used in financing activities increased from 2014 to 2015 is primarily driven by capital transactions with Alphabet, partially offset by net payments related to stock-based award activities.\nCash used in financing activities increased from 2013 to 2014 is primarily driven by an increase in net payments related to stock-based award activities, offset partially by a decrease in net cash payments related to debt.\nContractual Obligations as of December 31, 2015\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations, excluding open orders for purchases that support normal operations, as of December 31, 2015 (in millions):\n(1)\nFor further information, refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(2)\nPurchase obligations represent non-cancelable contractual obligations primarily related to data center operations and facility build-outs, video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, as well as purchases of inventory.\n(3)\nFor further information, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(4)\nOther long-term liabilities represent cash obligations recorded on our consolidated balance sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities and consist primarily of payments owed in connection with certain commercial agreements, investments and asset retirement obligations. In addition to the amounts above, we had long-term tax payable of $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2015 primarily related to uncertain tax positions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes. As a result, this amount is not included in the above table.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2015, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some cases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we discuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors.\nPlease see Note 1 of Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the summary of significant accounting policies.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nAlthough we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties. In addition, we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against us. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, indirect taxes, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes to our disclosures as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. Until the final resolution of such matters, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding contingencies.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair values\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nof assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.\nCritical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology; and discount rates. Management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.\nOther estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more fully discussed in Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is allocated to reporting units expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Goodwill impairment tests require judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. As of December 31, 2015, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, including property and equipment, long-term prepayments, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows independent of other assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Securities\nWe periodically review our marketable and non-marketable securities for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For marketable debt securities, we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income (expense), net.",
         "ITEM 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenues, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weakening of the U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. As of December 31, 2015, our most significant currency exposures are the British pound, Euro, and Japanese yen.\nWe use foreign exchange option contracts to protect our forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent earnings from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These hedging contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse currency exchange rate movements. We designate these option contracts as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The fair value of the option contract is separated into its intrinsic and time values. Changes in the time value are recorded in other income (expense), net. Changes in the intrinsic value are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently reclassified into revenues to offset the hedged exposures as they occur.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that changes in exchange rates of 20% could be experienced in the near term. If the U.S. dollar weakened by 20% as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, the amount recorded in AOCI reflecting intrinsic value related to our\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nforeign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately $686 million and $280 million lower as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, and the total amount of expense recorded as other income (expense), net, would have been approximately $90 million and $275 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015. If the U.S. dollar strengthened by 20% as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, the amount recorded in accumulated AOCI related to our foreign exchange options before tax effect would have been approximately $2.5 billion and $3.1 billion higher as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, and the total amount of expense recorded as other income (expense), net, would have been approximately $164 million and $372 million higher in the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015. In both scenarios, the change in the intrinsic value would be expected to offset a corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenues when recognized.\nIn addition, we use foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the foreign exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses on the assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, which are offset by the gains and losses on the forward contracts.\nWe considered the historical trends in currency exchange rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% for all currencies could be experienced in the near term. These reasonably possible adverse changes in exchange rates of 20% were applied to total monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currencies at the balance sheet dates to compute the adverse impact these changes would have had on our income before income taxes in the near term. These changes would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income taxes of approximately $93 million and $122 million as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015. The adverse impact as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately $948 million and $1.1 billion from foreign exchange contracts in place for the months of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur investment strategy is to achieve a return that will allow us to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements. We invest primarily in debt securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued by foreign governments. By policy, we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Our investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. As of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015, unrealized losses on our marketable debt securities were primarily due to temporary interest rate fluctuations as a result of higher market interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. We account for both fixed and variable rate securities at fair value with changes on gains and losses recorded in AOCI until the securities are sold. We use interest rate derivative contracts to hedge gains and losses on our securities. These derivative contracts are accounted for as hedges at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense), net.\nWe considered the historical volatility of short-term interest rates and determined that it was reasonably possible that an adverse change of 100 basis points could be experienced in the near term. A hypothetical 1.00% (100 basis points) increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our marketable securities of approximately $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.",

Alphabet Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

We generate revenues primarily by delivering relevant, cost-effective online advertising.\nOn April 17, 2013, we sold the Motorola Home business (Motorola Home) to Arris Group, Inc. (Arris). The financial results of Motorola Home are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2013. See Note 9 for further discussion of the sale.\nOn April 2, 2014, we completed a two-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend (the Stock Split). All references made to share or per share amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and applicable disclosures have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split. See Note 12 for additional information about the Stock Split.\nOn October 29, 2014, we sold the Motorola Mobile business (Motorola Mobile) to Lenovo Group Limited (Lenovo). The financial results of Motorola Mobile are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014. See Note 9 for further discussion of the sale.\nOn August 10, 2015, we announced plans to create a new public holding company, Alphabet Inc. (Alphabet), and a new operating structure. On October 2, 2015, we implemented the holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet became the successor issuer to Google Inc. (Google).\nThe implementation of the holding company reorganization on October 2, 2015 was accounted for as a merger under common control. Alphabet has recognized the assets and liabilities of Google at carryover basis. The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet present comparative information for prior years on a combined basis, as if both Alphabet and Google were under common control for all periods presented.\nThe consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are being presented in a combined report being filed by two separate registrants: Alphabet and Google. The Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are the only statements with differences between Alphabet and Google. The differences relate to transactions between Alphabet and Google which are accounted for as capital transactions. Refer to Note 13 for additional information.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet and Google include the accounts of Alphabet and Google, respectively, and all wholly owned subsidiaries as well as all variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table presents our revenues by segment and revenue source (in millions):\n(1)\nPrior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the reclassification primarily related to DoubleClick ad serving software revenues from Google other revenues to Advertising Revenues from Google Network Members' websites to conform with current period presentation.\nWe generate revenues primarily by delivering performance and brand advertising. Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click, leading to direct engagement with advertisers. Brand advertising enhances users’ awareness of and affinity with advertisers’ products and services, through videos, text, images, and other ads that run across various devices.\nGoogle AdWords is our auction-based advertising program that enables performance advertisers to place text-based and display ads on Google websites and our Google Network Members’ websites. Google AdSense refers to the online programs through which we distribute our advertisers’ AdWords ads for display on our Google Network Members’ websites. Most of our customers pay us on a cost-per-click basis, which means that an advertiser pays us only when a user engages with the ads by clicking on an ad on Google websites or Google Network Members' websites or by viewing YouTube engagement ads like TrueView (counted as an engagement when the user chooses not to skip the ad). We also offer advertising on a cost-per-impression basis that enables our brand advertisers to pay us based on the number of times their ads display on Google websites and our Google Network Members’ websites as specified by the advertisers.\nRevenue from advertising is recognized when the services have been provided or delivered, the fees we charge are fixed or determinable, we and our advertisers or other customers understand the specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transactions, and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time a user clicks on one of the ads that appears next to the search results or content on Google websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. For those advertisers using our cost-per-impression pricing, we recognize as revenues the fees charged to advertisers each time their ads are displayed on Google websites or our Google Network Members’ websites. We report our Google AdSense revenues and traffic acquisition costs due to our Google Network Members on a gross basis principally because we are the primary obligor to our advertisers.\nRevenue from hardware sales to end customers or through distribution channels is generally recognized when products have been shipped, risk of loss has transferred to the customer, objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met, no significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts, price protection, returns and customer incentives can be reasonably and reliably estimated. Revenues are reported net of these allowances. Where these allowances cannot be reasonably and reliably estimated, we recognize revenue at the time the product sells through the distribution channel to the end customer or when the return period elapsed, as applicable.\nFor the sale of certain third-party products and services, we evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customers or the net amount earned as revenue share. Generally, when we record revenue on a gross basis, we are the primary obligor in a transaction, and have also considered other factors, including whether we are subject to inventory risk or have latitude in establishing prices.\nFor multi-element arrangements, including those that contain software essential to hardware products’ functionality and services, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, we use a hierarchy to determine the selling prices to be used for allocating revenue: (i) vendor-specific objective\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nevidence of fair value (VSOE), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price, and (iii) best estimate of the selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged by us for that deliverable. ESPs reflect our best estimates of what the selling price of the deliverable would be if it was sold regularly on a stand-alone basis.\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received in advance of our performance in the underlying agreement on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues consists of traffic acquisition costs which are the advertising revenues shared with our Google Network Members and the amounts paid to our distribution partners who distribute our browser or otherwise direct search queries to our website.\nAdditionally, other costs of revenues includes the following:\n•\nThe expenses associated with the operation of our data centers (including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs);\n•\nContent acquisition costs primarily related to payments to certain content providers from whom we license their video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we share most of the fees these sales generate with content providers or pay a fixed fee to these content providers);\n•\nCredit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions;\n•\nStock-based compensation expense;\n•\nRevenue share payments to mobile carriers;\n•\nInventory costs for hardware we sell; and\n•\nAmortization of certain intangible assets.\nStock-based Compensation\nRestricted stock units (RSUs) are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. Shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the minimum statutory tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, the actual number of shares issued will be fewer than the actual number of RSUs outstanding. We record the liability for withholding amounts to be paid by us primarily as a reduction to additional paid-in capital when paid.\nFor stock option awards, we determined fair value using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option pricing model on the date of grant.\nStock-based compensation includes awards we expect to settle in Alphabet stock as well as awards we will ultimately settle in cash. We recognize stock-based compensation, less an estimate for forfeitures, using the straight-line method over the requisite service period. Additionally, stock-based compensation for liability classified awards reflect changes in fair value during the requisite service period.\nWe include as part of cash flows from financing activities the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the tax-effected compensation of the related stock-based awards for options exercised and RSUs vested during the period. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $1,174 million, $465 million, and $393 million, respectively.\nWe have elected to account for the indirect effects of stock-based awards -- primarily the research and development tax credit -- through the Consolidated Statements of Income. Total direct tax benefit realized, including the excess tax benefit, from stock-based award activities during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015, was $1,195 million, $1,356 million, and $1,544 million, respectively.\nCertain Risks and Concentrations\nOur revenues are primarily derived from online advertising, the market for which is highly competitive and rapidly changing. In addition, our revenues are generated from a multitude of vertical market segments in countries around the world. Significant changes in this industry or changes in customer buying or advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to concentrations of credit risk principally from cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of time deposits, money market and other funds, including cash collateral received related to our securities lending program, highly liquid debt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments and municipalities in the U.S., corporate securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. In 2013, 2014, and 2015, we generated approximately 46%, 45%, and 46% of our revenues from customers based in the U.S., with the majority of revenues from customers outside of the U.S. located in Europe and Japan. We perform ongoing evaluations to determine customer credit and we limit the amount of credit we extend, but generally we do not require collateral from our customers. We maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations.\nNo individual customer or groups of affiliated customers represented more than 10% of our revenues in 2013, 2014, or 2015.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial assets and financial liabilities that include cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. We measure certain financial assets at fair value for disclosure purposes, as well as, on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. Our other current financial assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying value.\nFair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that is determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with a three-tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the inputs available in the market used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activities.\nThe fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nWe invest all excess cash primarily in debt securities including those of the U.S. government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued by foreign governments.\nWe classify all investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have stated maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase as cash equivalents and those with stated maturities of greater than three months as marketable securities.\nWe determine the appropriate classification of our investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such designation at each balance sheet date. We have classified and accounted for our marketable securities as available-for-sale. After consideration of our risk versus reward objectives, as well as our liquidity requirements, we may sell these securities prior to their stated maturities. As we view these securities as available to support current operations, we classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond 12 months as current assets under the caption marketable securities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We carry these securities at fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, as a component of stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses determined to be other-than-temporary, which we record within other income (expense), net. We determine any realized gains or losses on the sale of marketable securities on a specific identification method, and we record such gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net.\nNon-Marketable Investments\nWe have accounted for non-marketable equity investments either under the equity or cost method. Investments through which we exercise significant influence but do not have control over the investee are accounted for under the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nWe have accounted for our non-marketable investments that meet the definition of a debt security as available-for-sale securities. Since these securities do not have contractual maturity dates and we do not intend to liquidate them in the next 12 months, we have classified them as non-current assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe make a determination at the start of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment is considered a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). We consolidate VIEs in which we have a controlling financial interest. If we do not have a controlling financial interest in a VIE, we account for the investment under either the equity or cost method.\nImpairment of Marketable and Non-Marketable Investments\nWe periodically review our marketable and non-marketable investments for impairment. If we conclude that any of these investments are impaired, we determine whether such impairment is other-than-temporary. Factors we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment, the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell. For debt securities, we also consider whether (1) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, and (2) the amortized cost basis cannot be recovered as a result of credit losses. If any impairment is considered other-than-temporary, we will write down the asset to its fair value and record the corresponding charge as other income (expense), net.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at the invoiced amount and we normally do not charge interest. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. We review the accounts receivable by amounts due by customers which are past due to identify specific customers with known disputes or collectability issues. In determining the amount of the reserve, we make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. We also maintain a sales allowance to reserve for potential credits issued to customers. We determine the amount of the reserve based on historical credits issued.\nProperty and Equipment\nWe account for property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally two to five years. We depreciate buildings over periods up to 25 years. We amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. Construction in progress is the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for our intended use. Depreciation for equipment commences once it is placed in service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land is not depreciated.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe expense software development costs, including costs to develop software products or the software component of products to be marketed to external users, before technological feasibility is reached. Technological feasibility is typically reached shortly before the release of such products and as a result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented.\nSoftware development costs also include costs to develop software to be used solely to meet internal needs and cloud based applications used to deliver our services. We capitalize development costs related to these software applications once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe include the results of operations of the businesses that we acquire as of the respective dates of acquisition. We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill.\nLong-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nWe review property and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nrecoverable. We measure recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets or the asset group are expected to generate. If the assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value. In 2014, we recorded impairments of intangible assets, including an impairment of $378 million in the third quarter of 2014 related to a patent licensing royalty asset. Impairments of intangible assets were not material in 2015.\nWe allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We evaluate our reporting units when changes in our operating structure occur, and if necessary, reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach. We test our goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. No goodwill impairment has been identified in any of the years presented.\nIntangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one to twelve years.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns. We measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based on provisions of enacted tax law. We evaluate the realization of our deferred tax assets based on all available evidence and establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that they will not be realized.\nWe recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more-likely-than not that, based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefits of the position recognized in the financial statements are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with a taxing authority. In addition, we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision.\nForeign Currency\nGenerally, the functional currency of our international subsidiaries is the local currency. We translate the financial statements of these subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders’ equity. We reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to functional currency as a component of foreign currency exchange losses in other income (expense), net.\nAdvertising and Promotional Expenses\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs in the period in which they are incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, advertising and promotional expenses totaled approximately $2,389 million, $3,004 million, and $3,186 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09) \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\" ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in “Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)”, and requires entities to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. As currently issued and amended, ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, though early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements, implementing accounting system changes related to the adoption, and considering additional disclosure requirements.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10 (ASU 2014-10) \"Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation.\" ASU 2014-10 removes the definition of a development stage entity from the Master Glossary of the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities. The additional elimination of related consolidation guidance will require companies with interests in development stage entities to reassess whether such entities are variable interest entities under ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. We will adopt this standard in the first quarter\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nof 2016 on a retrospective basis. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02 (ASU 2015-02) \"Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.\" ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. We will adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2016 on a retrospective basis. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations or consolidated balance sheet, but it may result in additional disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17 (ASU 2015-17) “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes”. ASU 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by eliminating the separate classification of deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in the consolidated balance sheet statement of financial position. The amendments in the update require that all deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods therein and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. We have early adopted this standard in the fourth quarter of 2015 on a retrospective basis. Prior periods have been retrospectively adjusted.\nAs a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-17, the Company made the following adjustments to the 2014 balance sheet: a $1,322 million decrease to current deferred tax assets, a $83 million increase to noncurrent deferred tax asset, a $26 million decrease to current deferred tax liability, and a decrease of $1,213 million to noncurrent deferred tax liability.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01 (ASU 2016-01) \"Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\" ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure for financial instruments. With respect to our consolidated financial statements, the most significant impact relates to the accounting for equity investments. It will impact the disclosure and presentation of financial assets and liabilities. ASU 2016-01 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption by public entities is permitted only for certain provisions. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevision of Previously Issued Financial Statements\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities, and as a consequence, we revised our income tax expense for periods beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015 in the cumulative amount of $711 million. We evaluated the materiality of the income tax expense impact quantitatively and qualitatively and concluded it was not material to any of the prior periods impacted and that correction of income tax expense as an out of period adjustment in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 would not be material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2015. Consolidated revenues are not impacted. We elected to revise previously issued consolidated financial statements for the periods impacted. Refer to Note 17 for additional information.\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.\nNote 2. Financial Instruments\nWe classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities within Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices or alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine their fair value. We classify our foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as the valuation inputs are based on quoted prices and market observable data of similar instruments.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities\nThe following tables summarize our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities by significant investment categories as of December 31, 2014 and 2015 (in millions):\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\n(1)\nThe majority of our time deposits are foreign deposits.\n(2)\nThe balances as of December 31, 2014 and 2015 were related to cash collateral received in connection with our securities lending program, which was invested in reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months. See section titled \"Securities Lending Program\" below for further discussion of this program.\n(3)\nFixed-income bond funds consist of mutual funds that primarily invest in corporate and government bonds.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the marketable securities on a specific identification method. We recognized gross realized gains of $416 million, $238 million, and $357 million for the years ended December 31,\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\n2013, 2014, and 2015. We recognized gross realized losses of $258 million, $85 million, and $565 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015. We reflect these gains and losses as a component of other income (expense), net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair value of our investments in marketable debt securities, accounted for as available-for-sale securities and classified by the contractual maturity date of the securities (in millions):\nThe following tables present gross unrealized losses and fair values for those investments that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, aggregated by investment category and the length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position (in millions):\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, we did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairment loss. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $281 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses related to our marketable equity securities and fixed-income bond funds. Those losses are included in gains (losses) on marketable securities, net as a component of other income (expense), net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 10 for further details on other income (expense), net.\nSecurities Lending Program\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nFrom time to time, we enter into securities lending agreements with financial institutions to enhance investment income. We loan certain securities which are collateralized in the form of cash or securities. Cash collateral is usually invested in reverse repurchase agreements which are collateralized in the form of securities.\nWe classify loaned securities as cash equivalents or marketable securities and record the cash collateral as an asset with a corresponding liability in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We classify reverse repurchase agreements maturing within three months as cash equivalents and those longer than three months as receivable under reverse repurchase agreements in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. For security collateral received, we do not record an asset or liability except in the event of counterparty default.\nOur securities lending transactions were accounted for as secured borrowings with significant investment categories as follows (in millions):\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of the derivatives in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as other income (expense), net, as part of revenues, or as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, as discussed below.\nWe enter into foreign currency contracts with financial institutions to reduce the risk that our cash flows and earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use certain interest rate derivative contracts to hedge interest rate exposures on our fixed income securities and debt. Our program is not used for trading or speculative purposes.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. To further reduce credit risk, we enter into collateral security arrangements under which the counterparty is required to provide collateral when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. We can take possession of the collateral in the event of counterparty default. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, we received cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements of $268 million and $192 million.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe use options designated as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The notional principal of these contracts was approximately $13.6 billion and $16.4 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2015. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 36 months or less.\nIn 2012, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of $1.0 billion and terms calling for us to receive interest at a variable rate and to pay interest at a fixed rate, that effectively locked in an interest rate on our anticipated debt issuance of $1.0 billion in 2014. We issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in February 2014 (See details in Note 4). As a result, we terminated the forward-starting interest rate swaps upon the debt issuance. The cash gain associated with the termination is reported within Operating Activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2014, consistent with the impact of the hedged item.\nWe reflect gain or loss on the effective portion of a cash flow hedge as a component of AOCI and subsequently reclassify cumulative gains and losses to revenues or interest expense when the hedged transactions are recorded. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI would be immediately reclassified to other income (expense), net. Further, we exclude the change in the time value of the options from our\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nassessment of hedge effectiveness. We record the premium paid or time value of an option on the date of purchase as an asset. Thereafter, we recognize changes to this time value in other income (expense), net.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the effective portion of our cash flow hedges before tax effect was $375 million, of which $293 million is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.\nFair Value Hedges\nWe use forward contracts designated as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We exclude changes in the time value for forward contracts from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The notional principal of these contracts was $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2015.\nWe use interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges to hedge interest rate risk for certain fixed rate securities. The notional principal of these contracts was $175 million and $295 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2015.\nGains and losses on these forward contracts and interest rate swaps are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting losses and gains of the related hedged items.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of forward and option contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a subsidiary. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. The notional principal of foreign exchange contracts outstanding was $6.2 billion and $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2015.\nWe also use exchange-traded interest rate futures contracts and “To Be Announced” (TBA) forward purchase commitments of mortgage-backed assets to hedge interest rate risks on certain fixed income securities. The TBA contracts meet the definition of derivative instruments in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. Our interest rate futures and TBA contracts (together interest rate contracts) are not designated as hedging instruments. We recognize gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs, in other income (expense), net. The gains and losses are generally economically offset by unrealized gains and losses in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of AOCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are moved from AOCI into other income (expense), net. The total notional amounts of interest rate contracts outstanding were $150 million and $50 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2015.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe fair values of our outstanding derivative instruments were as follows (in millions):\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe effect of derivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships on income and other comprehensive income (OCI) is summarized below (in millions):\n(1)\nGains (losses) related to the ineffective portion of the hedges were not material in all periods presented.\nThe effect of derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationships on income is summarized below (in millions):\n(2)\nLosses related to the amount excluded from effectiveness testing of the hedges were $9 million, $8 million, and $6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on income is summarized below (in millions):\nOffsetting of Derivatives, Securities Lending, and Reverse Repurchase Agreements\nWe present our derivatives, securities lending and reverse repurchase agreements at gross fair values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, our master netting and other similar arrangements allow net settlements under certain conditions. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, information related to these offsetting arrangements was as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nThe balances as of December 31, 2014 and 2015 were related to derivative liabilities which are allowed to be net settled against derivative assets in accordance with our master netting agreements.\n(2)\nThe balances as of December 31, 2014 and 2015 included $1,762 million and $1,140 million recorded in cash and cash equivalents, respectively, and $875 million and $450 million recorded in receivable under reverse repurchase agreements, respectively.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\n(3)\nThe balances as of December 31, 2014 and 2015 were related to derivative assets which are allowed to be net settled against derivative liabilities in accordance with our master netting agreements.\nNote 3. Non-Marketable Investments\nOur non-marketable investments include non-marketable equity investments and non-marketable debt securities.\nNon-Marketable Equity Investments\nOur non-marketable equity investments are investments we have made in privately-held companies accounted for under the equity or cost method and are not required to be consolidated under the variable interest or voting models. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, these investments accounted for under the equity method had a carrying value of approximately $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, and those investments accounted for under the cost method had a carrying value of $1.8 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. For investments accounted for under the cost method, the fair value was approximately $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2015. The fair value of the cost method investments are primarily determined from data leveraging private-market transactions and are classified within Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. We periodically review our non-marketable equity investments for impairment. No material impairments were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015. Our share of gains and losses in equity method investments for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a net loss of approximately $227 million and not material for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014. We reflect these losses as a component of other income (expense), net, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe determined that certain renewable energy investments included in our non-marketable equity investments are VIEs. However, we do not consolidate these entities in our financial statements because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and account for those investments under the equity method. Our involvement with investments in renewable energy relate to our equity investments in entities whose activities involve power generation. We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that would significantly impact the entity's economic performance such as setting operating budgets. The carrying value of our renewable energy investments accounted for under the equity method that are VIEs is $302 million as of December 31, 2015 with the maximum exposure of $316 million. The maximum exposure is based on current investments to date plus future funding commitments. We have determined the single source of our exposure to these VIE’s is our capital investment in these entities. We periodically reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The reassessment process considers whether we have acquired the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE through changes in governing documents or other circumstances. We also reconsider whether entities previously determined not to be VIEs have become VIEs, based on changes in facts and circumstances including changes in contractual arrangements and capital structure.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nNon-Marketable Debt Securities\nOur non-marketable debt securities are primarily preferred stock that are redeemable at our option and convertible notes issued by private companies. These debt securities do not have readily determinable market values and are categorized accordingly as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. To estimate the fair value of these securities, we use a combination of valuation methodologies, including market and income approaches based on prior transaction prices; estimated timing, probability, and amount of cash flows; and illiquidity considerations. Financial information of private companies may not be available and consequently we will estimate the value based on the best available information at the measurement date. We estimate a range of fair values based on valuation approaches noted above and as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, the fair value recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for individual investments is within the range. No material impairments were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation for our assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):\n(1)\nPurchases of securities included our $900 million investment in SpaceX, a space exploration and space transport company, made during January 2015.\nNote 4. Debt\nShort-Term Debt\nWe have a debt financing program of up to $3.0 billion through the issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, we had $2.0 billion of outstanding commercial paper recorded as short-term debt with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively. In conjunction with this program, we have a $3.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in July 2016. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the credit facility, and no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2014 and 2015. The estimated fair value of the short-term debt approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2014 and 2015.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nLong-Term Debt\nWe issued $1.0 billion of unsecured senior notes (the \"2014 Notes\") in February 2014 and $3.0 billion of unsecured senior notes in three tranches (collectively, the \"2011 Notes\") in May 2011. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2011 Notes to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. We used the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2014 Notes for the repayment of the portion of the principal amount of our 2011 Notes which matured on May 19, 2014 and for general corporate purposes. The total outstanding Notes are summarized below (in millions):\nThe effective interest yields of the Notes due in 2016, 2021, and 2024 were 2.241%, 3.734%, and 3.377%, respectively. Interest on the 2011 and 2014 Notes is payable semi-annually. The 2011 and 2014 Notes rank equally with each other and with all of our other senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness from time to time outstanding. We may redeem the 2011 and 2014 Notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the 2011 Notes or the 2014 Notes. The total estimated fair value of the 2011 and 2014 Notes was approximately $3.1 billion at both December 31, 2014 and 2015. The fair value of the outstanding 2011 and 2014 Notes was determined based on observable market prices in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nIn August 2013, we entered into a capital lease obligation on certain property expiring in 2028. We intend to exercise the option to purchase the property in 2016, and as such the long term portion of the capital lease obligation was reclassified as short term. The effective rate of the capital lease obligation approximates the market rate. The estimated fair value of the capital lease obligation approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2014 and 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2015, aggregate future principal payments for long-term debt (including short-term portion of long-term debt) and capital lease obligation were as follows (in millions):\nIn January 2016, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to issue up to $5.0 billion of commercial paper from time to time and to enter into a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility to replace Google's existing $3.0 billion revolving credit facility.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nNote 5. Balance Sheet Components\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net, consisted of the following (in millions):\nProperty under capital lease with a cost basis of $258 million was included in land and buildings as of December 31, 2015.\nPrepaid Revenue Share, Expenses and Other Assets, Non-Current\nNote Receivable\nIn connection with the sale of our Motorola Mobile business on October 29, 2014 (see Note 9 for additional information), we received an interest-free, three-year prepayable promissory note (the \"Note Receivable\") due October 2017 from Lenovo. The Note Receivable is included in prepaid revenue share, expenses and other assets, non-current, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Based on the general market conditions and the credit quality of Lenovo, we discounted the Note Receivable at an effective interest rate of 4.5%. The outstanding balances are shown in the table below (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2014 and 2015, we did not recognize a valuation allowance on the Note Receivable.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe components of AOCI, net of tax, were as follows (in millions):\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe effects on net income of amounts reclassified from AOCI were as follows (in millions):\nNote 6. Acquisitions\n2015 Acquisitions\nbebop Technologies\nIn December 2015, we completed the acquisition of bebop Technologies Inc. (bebop), a company with a cloud-based development platform focused on enterprise applications. The fair value of total consideration transferred in connection with the close was $272 million, of which $1 million was paid in cash and $271 million was paid in the form of Alphabet Class C capital stock. We issued a total of approximately 514 thousand shares of Alphabet Class C capital\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nstock in relation to this acquisition, part of which will be accounted for as compensation expense. The fair value of the shares of capital stock issued was determined based on the closing market price of Alphabet's Class C capital stock as of the close date. The Class C capital stock issued by Alphabet in connection with the acquisition was treated as a capital contribution from Alphabet to Google. We expect the acquisition will help us provide a new platform to build and maintain enterprise applications. As part of the acquisition, Diane Greene, the former CEO of bebop and a member of our Board of Directors, has joined Google.\nOf the total purchase price of $272 million, $28 million was cash acquired, $59 million was attributed to intangible assets, $206 million was attributed to goodwill, and $21 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. The goodwill of $206 million is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $263 million. In aggregate, $4 million was cash acquired, $88 million was attributed to intangible assets, $138 million was attributed to goodwill, and $33 million was attributed to net assets acquired. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expanding our expertise in engineering and other functional areas. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $20 million.\nPro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in aggregate.\nFor all acquisitions and purchases completed during the year ended December 31, 2015, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 4.1 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 4.0 years, and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 6.8 years.\n2014 Acquisitions\nNest\nIn February 2014, we completed the acquisition of Nest Labs, Inc. (Nest), a company whose mission is to reinvent devices in the home such as thermostats and smoke alarms. Prior to this transaction, we had an approximately 12% ownership interest in Nest. The acquisition is expected to enhance Google's suite of products and services and allow Nest to continue to innovate upon devices in the home, making them more useful, intuitive, and thoughtful, and to reach more users in more countries.\nOf the total $2.6 billion purchase price and the fair value of our previously held equity interest of $152 million, $51 million was cash acquired, $430 million was attributed to intangible assets, $2.3 billion was attributed to goodwill, and $84 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. The goodwill of $2.3 billion is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nThis transaction is considered a “step acquisition” under GAAP whereby our ownership interest in Nest held before the acquisition was remeasured to fair value at the date of the acquisition. Such fair value was estimated by using discounted cash flow valuation methodologies. Inputs used in the methodologies primarily included projected future cash flows, discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved. The gain of $103 million as a result of remeasurement is included in other income (expense), net, on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDropcam\nIn July 2014, Nest completed the acquisition of Dropcam, Inc. (Dropcam), a company that enables consumers and businesses to monitor their homes and offices via video, for approximately $517 million in cash. With Dropcam on board, Nest expects to continue to reinvent products that will help shape the future of the connected home. Of the total purchase price of $517 million, $11 million was cash acquired, $55 million was attributed to intangible assets, $452 million was attributed to goodwill, and $1 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. The goodwill of $452 million is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nSkybox\nIn August 2014, we completed the acquisition of Skybox Imaging, Inc. (Skybox), a satellite imaging company, for approximately $478 million in cash. We expect the acquisition to keep Google Maps accurate with up-to-date imagery and, over time, improve internet access and disaster relief. Of the total purchase price of $478 million, $6 million was cash acquired, $69 million was attributed to intangible assets, $388 million was attributed to goodwill, and $15 million\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nwas attributed to net assets acquired. The goodwill of $388 million is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. Goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we completed other acquisitions and purchases of intangible assets for total consideration of approximately $1,466 million, which includes the fair value of our previously held equity interest of $33 million. In aggregate, $65 million was cash acquired, $405 million was attributed to intangible assets, $1,045 million was attributed to goodwill, and $49 million was attributed to net liabilities assumed. These acquisitions generally enhance the breadth and depth of our offerings, as well as expanding our expertise in engineering and other functional areas. The amount of goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes is approximately $55 million.\nPro forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to the consolidated results of operations, either individually or in aggregate.\nFor all acquisitions and purchases completed during the year ended December 31, 2014, patents and developed technology have a weighted-average useful life of 5.1 years, customer relationships have a weighted-average useful life of 4.5 years, and trade names and other have a weighted-average useful life of 6.9 years.\nNote 7. Collaboration Agreement\nOn September 18, 2013, we announced the formation of Calico, a life science company with a mission to harness advanced technologies to increase our understanding of the biology that controls lifespan. Calico's results of operations and statement of financial position are included in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2015, Google has contributed $240 million to Calico in exchange for Calico convertible preferred units. As of December 31, 2015, Google has also committed to fund an additional $490 million on an as-needed basis.\nIn September 2014, AbbVie Inc. (AbbVie) and Calico announced a research and development collaboration intended to help both companies discover, develop, and bring to market new therapies for patients with age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration and cancer. As of December 31, 2015, AbbVie has contributed $750 million to fund the collaboration pursuant to the agreement, which reflects its total commitment. As of December 31, 2015, Calico has contributed $250 million and committed up to an additional $500 million.\nCalico will use its scientific expertise to establish a world-class research and development facility, with a focus on drug discovery and early drug development; and AbbVie will provide scientific and clinical development support and its commercial expertise to bring new discoveries to market. Both companies will share costs and profits equally. AbbVie's contribution has been recorded as a liability on Calico's financial statements, which is reduced and reflected as a reduction to research and development expense as eligible research and development costs are incurred by Calico over the next few years.\nNote 8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nIn conjunction with the Alphabet reorganization we are implementing a new operating structure. Consequently, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we have multiple operating segments and reporting units, representing the individual businesses run separately under the Alphabet structure. Refer to Note 16 for further information. In conjunction with the changes to reporting units, we allocated goodwill to each reporting unit based on their relative fair values. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to our disclosed segments for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 were as follows (in millions):\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nOther Intangible Assets\nInformation regarding our purchased intangible assets is as follows (in millions):\nPatents and developed technology, customer relationships, and trade names and other have weighted-average useful lives from the date of purchase of 7.8 years, 6.0 years, and 5.4 years, respectively. Amortization expense relating to our purchased intangible assets was $1,011 million, $1,079 million, and $892 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we recorded an impairment charge in other cost of revenues of $378 million related to a patent licensing royalty asset acquired in connection with the Motorola acquisition, which we retained subsequent to the sale of Motorola Mobile. The asset was determined to be impaired due to prolonged decreased royalty payments and unpaid interest owed and was written down to its fair value. Fair value was determined based on a discounted cash flow method and reflects estimated future cash flows associated with the patent licensing royalty asset at the measurement date and falls within level 3 in fair value hierarchy. Impairments of intangible assets were not material for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nAs of December 31, 2015, expected amortization expense for our purchased intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter was as follows (in millions):\nNote 9. Discontinued Operations\nMotorola Mobile\nOn October 29, 2014, we closed the sale of the Motorola Mobile business to Lenovo for a total purchase price of approximately $2.9 billion, including $1.4 billion paid at close, comprised of $660 million in cash and $750 million in Lenovo ordinary shares (519.1 million shares). The remaining $1.5 billion was paid in the form of an interest-free, three-year prepayable promissory note.\nWe maintain ownership of the vast majority of the Motorola Mobile patent portfolio, including pre-closing patent applications and invention disclosures, which we licensed to Motorola Mobile for its continued operations. Additionally, in connection with the sale, we agreed to indemnify Lenovo for certain potential liabilities of the Motorola Mobile business, for which we recorded an indemnification liability of $130 million.\nThe sale resulted in a gain of $740 million, net of tax, which was presented as part of net income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014. Incremental to this net gain, we recognized additional income of $254 million, net of tax, in connection with certain IP licensing arrangements between the parties, included as part of net income from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe financial results of Motorola Mobile through the date of divestiture are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The following table presents financial results of the Motorola Mobile business included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 (in millions):\n(1)\nThe operating results of Motorola Mobile were included in our Consolidated Statements of Income from January 1, 2014 through October 29, 2014, the date of divestiture.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe following table presents the aggregate carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities divested (in millions):\nMotorola Home\nOn April 17, 2013, we sold the Motorola Home business to Arris for consideration of approximately $2,412 million in cash, including cash of $2,238 million received at the date of close and certain post-close adjustments of $174 million received in the third quarter of 2013, and approximately $175 million in Arris' common stock (10.6 million shares). Subsequent to the transaction, we own approximately 7.8% of the outstanding shares of Arris. Additionally, in connection with the disposition, we agreed to indemnify Arris for potential liability from certain intellectual property infringement litigation, for which we recorded an indemnification liability of $175 million, the majority of which was settled subsequent to the disposition.\nThe disposition resulted in a net gain of $757 million, which was presented as part of net income from discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nThe financial results of Motorola Home through the date of divestiture are presented as net income (loss) from discontinued operations on the Consolidated Statement of Income. The following table presents financial results of the Motorola Home business included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 (in millions):\n(1)The operating results of Motorola Home were included in our Consolidated Statements of Income from January 1, 2013 through April 17, 2013, the date of divestiture.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe following table presents the aggregate carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities divested (in millions):\nNote 10. Other Income (Expense), Net\nThe components of other income (expense), net, were as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nOur foreign currency exchange losses,net are related to the option premium costs and forward points for our foreign currency hedging contracts, our foreign exchange transaction gains and losses from the conversion of the transaction currency to the functional currency, offset by the foreign currency hedging contract losses and gains. The net foreign currency transaction losses were $121 million, $107 million, and $123 million in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively.\n(2)\nGain on divestiture of Motorola Home business was included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. Gain on divestiture of Motorola Mobile business was included in net income (loss) from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNote 11. Commitments and Contingencies\nOperating Leases\nWe have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for certain of our offices, facilities, land, and data centers throughout the world with original lease periods expiring primarily between 2016 and 2063. We are committed to pay a portion of the actual operating expenses under certain of these lease agreements. These operating expenses are not included in the table below. Certain of these arrangements have free or escalating rent payment provisions. We recognize rent expense under such arrangements on a straight-line basis.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nAs of December 31, 2015, future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases, net of sublease income amounts, were as follows over each of the next five years and thereafter (in millions):\nCertain leases have adjustments for market provisions. Amounts in the above table represent our best estimates of future payments to be made under these leases.\nWe entered into certain non-cancelable lease agreements with original lease periods expiring between 2021 and 2032 where we are the deemed owner for accounting purposes of new construction projects. Future minimum lease payments under such leases total approximately $678 million, of which $422 million is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015. These amounts are presented as an asset and corresponding non-current liability, which represents our estimate of construction costs incurred to date. They have been excluded from the table above.\nRent expense under operating leases, including co-location arrangements, was $465 million, $570 million, and $734 million in 2013, 2014, and 2015.\nPurchase Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $1.7 billion of other non-cancelable contractual obligations, primarily related to data center operations and facility build-outs, video and other content licensing revenue sharing arrangements, as well as certain inventory purchase commitments.\nLetters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had unused letters of credit for $752 million.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, to facilitate transactions in our services and products, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network Members, and lessors with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably possible. As part of the sale of Motorola Home and Motorola Mobile businesses, we issued indemnifications for certain potential liabilities. Please see Note 9 for additional information.\nLegal Matters\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn November 30, 2010, the European Commission's (EC) Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various antitrust-related complaints against us. On April 15, 2015, the EC issued a Statement of\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nObjections (SO) regarding the display and ranking of shopping search results. The EC also opened a formal investigation into Android. We responded to the SO on August 27, 2015 and will continue to cooperate with the EC.\nThe Comision Nacional de Defensa de la Competencia in Argentina, the Competition Commission of India (CCI), Brazil's Council for Economic Defense (CADE), the Canadian Competition Bureau (CCB), and the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) of the Russian Federation have also opened investigations into certain of our business practices. In August 2015, we received the CCI Director General's report with interim findings of competition law infringements regarding search and ads. In September 2015, FAS found that there has been a competition law infringement in Android mobile distribution. We will respond to the CCI's report and have filed an appeal of the FAS decision. In July 2015, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission informed us that it was closing its antitrust investigations of our business practices.\nThe state attorney general from Mississippi issued subpoenas in 2011 and 2012 in an antitrust investigation of our business practices. We have responded to those subpoenas, and we remain willing to cooperate with them if they have any further information requests.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights of others. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services, and may also cause us to change our business practices, and require development of non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss for a company or its suppliers in an ITC action could result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Since the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. Our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely impact our business.\nOther\nWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition (such as the pending EC investigations described above), intellectual property, privacy, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. Such claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings could result in fines, civil or criminal penalties, or other adverse consequences.\nCertain of our outstanding legal matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the possible loss. We evaluate, on a monthly basis, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.\nWith respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.\nWe expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nTaxes\nWe are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters. We have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities, and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations or agreements will not have a\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nmaterial effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state, and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it would result in a further charge to expense.\nPlease see Note 15 for additional information regarding contingencies related to our income taxes.\nNote 12. Net Income Per Share\nAlphabet\nWe compute net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and the effect of potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of stock options, restricted stock units, and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, and other contingently issuable shares is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock assumes the conversion of Class B common stock, while the diluted net income per share of Class B common stock does not assume the conversion of those shares.\nThe rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Further, there are a number of safeguards built into our certificate of incorporation, as well as Delaware law, which preclude our board of directors from declaring or paying unequal per share dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock. Specifically, Delaware law provides that amendments to our certificate of incorporation which would have the effect of adversely altering the rights, powers, or preferences of a given class of stock must be approved by the class of stock adversely affected by the proposed amendment. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that before any such amendment may be put to a stockholder vote, it must be approved by the unanimous consent of our board of directors. As a result, the undistributed earnings for each year are allocated based on the contractual participation rights of the Class A and Class B common shares and Class C capital stock as if the earnings for the year had been distributed. As the liquidation and dividend rights are identical, the undistributed earnings are allocated on a proportionate basis. The net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation. Further, as we assume the conversion of Class B common stock in the computation of the diluted net income per share of Class A common stock, the undistributed earnings are equal to net income for that computation.\nStock Split Effected In Form of Stock Dividend\nIn January 2014, our board of directors approved the distribution of shares of Class C capital stock as a dividend to our holders of Class A and Class B common stock (the Stock Split). The Stock Split had a record date of March 27, 2014 and a payment date of April 2, 2014.\nIn the second quarter of 2015, in accordance with a settlement of litigation involving the authorization to distribute Class C capital stock, at the close of trading on April 2, 2015, the last trading day of the 365 day period following the first date the Class C shares traded on NASDAQ (Lookback Period), we determined that a payment (the Adjustment Payment) in the amount of $522 million was due to Class C capital stockholders. The amount of the Adjustment Payment was based on the percentage difference that developed between the volume-weighted average price of Class A and Class C shares during the Lookback Period, as supplied by NASDAQ Data-on-Demand, and was payable to holders of Class C capital stock as of the end of the Lookback Period in cash, Class A common stock, Class C capital stock, or a combination thereof, at the discretion of our board of directors. On April 22, 2015, our board of directors approved the Adjustment Payment in shares of Class C capital stock, and cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Class C capital stock. In May 2015, the Adjustment Payment was made, resulting in the issuance of approximately 853 thousand shares of Class C capital stock, with $475 million reflected in additional-paid in capital and $47 million of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Class C capital stock.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2015, the Adjustment Payment was allocated to the numerator for calculating net income per share of Class C capital stock from net income available to all stockholders and the remaining undistributed earnings were allocated on a pro rata basis to Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock based on the number of shares used in the per share computation for each class of stock. The weighted-average share impact of the Adjustment Payment is included in the denominator of both basic and diluted net income per share computations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, the net income per share amounts are the same for Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock because the holders of each class are entitled to equal per share dividends or distributions in liquidation in accordance with our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Alphabet Inc.\nThe par value per share of our shares of Class A and Class B common stock remained unchanged at $0.001 per share after the Stock Split. On the effective date of the Stock Split, a transfer between retained earnings and common stock occurred in an amount equal to the $0.001 par value of the Class C capital stock that was issued.\nShare and per share amounts for the prior periods presented below have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\nComputation of Net Income Per Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share of Class A and Class B common stock and Class C capital stock (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands and per share amounts):\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nGoogle\nNet income per share for Google is not required as its shares are not publicly traded.\nNote 13. Stockholders’ Equity\nAlphabet Reorganization\nOn October 2, 2015, Google implemented a legal reorganization, which resulted in Alphabet owning all of the outstanding stock of Google. Consequently, Google became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Each share of each class of Google stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the legal reorganization automatically converted into an equivalent corresponding share of Alphabet stock, and Google’s stockholders immediately prior to the consummation of the legal reorganization became stockholders of Alphabet.\nAs a result of the reorganization, on October 2, 2015, the Fourth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Google was amended to decrease the authorized number of shares of Class A common stock, Class B common\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nstock and Class C capital stock, par value $0.001 per share, from 9 billion shares, 3 billion shares and 3 billion shares, respectively, to 500 shares of each class of stock, respectively. Additionally, the authorized number of shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, was decreased from 100 million shares to 500 shares. As of December 31, 2015, Google had 100 shares of Class A common stock, 100 shares of Class B common stock, and 100 shares of Class C capital stock outstanding, of which Alphabet was the sole owner.\nAlphabet Convertible Preferred Stock\nOur board of directors has authorized 100 million shares of convertible preferred stock, $0.001 par value, issuable in series. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, there were no shares issued or outstanding.\nAlphabet Class A and Class B Common Stock and Class C Capital Stock\nOur board of directors has authorized three classes of stock, Class A and Class B common stock, and Class C capital stock. The rights of the holders of each class of our common and capital stock are identical, except with respect to voting. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to one vote per share. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Class C capital stock has no voting rights, except as required by applicable law. Shares of Class B common stock may be converted at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer to Class A common stock.\nStock Plans\nAs a result of the Alphabet reorganization, on October 2, 2015, Google transferred to Alphabet, and Alphabet assumed, sponsorship of all of Google's stock plans along with all of Google's rights and obligations under each plan.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, shares reserved for future grants under the 2004 Stock Plan expired and we began granting awards from the 2012 Stock Plan (“Stock Plan”). Under our Stock Plan, RSUs or stock options may be granted. An RSU award is an agreement to issue shares of our publicly traded stock at the time the award vests. Incentive and non-qualified stock options, or rights to purchase common stock, are generally granted for a term of 10 years. Options and RSUs granted to participants under the Stock Plan generally vest over four years contingent upon employment or service with us on the vesting date.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there were 23,336,944 shares of stock reserved for future issuance under our Stock Plan.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe following table presents our aggregate stock-based compensation expense by type of costs and expenses per the Consolidated Statements of Income (in millions):\nFor the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015, we recognized tax benefits on total stock-based compensation expense from continuing operations of $685 million, $867 million, and $1,133 million, respectively, and from discontinued operations of $59 million, $30 million and $0 million, respectively. In addition, as a result of the Tax Court ruling in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, we have recorded a tax benefit of $522 million related to 2015 stock-based compensation expense that will be subject to reimbursement of cost share payments if the tax court's opinion is sustained. Refer to Note 15 for more detail regarding the Altera case.\nOf the total stock-based compensation expense from continuing operations recognized in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015, $0 million, $0 million, and $50 million, respectively, was associated with awards ultimately settled in cash. Awards which will be ultimately settled in cash are classified as liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nStock-based compensation associated with Alphabet equity awards granted to Google employees in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015, was treated as a capital contribution from Alphabet to Google. Stock-based\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\ncompensation associated with equity awards for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 are presented as stock-based compensation expense in Alphabet's and Google's Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.\nAlphabet Stock-Based Award Activities\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our options for the year ended December 31, 2015:\n(1)\nThe aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the closing stock prices of $778.01 and $758.88 of our Class A common stock and Class C capital stock, respectively, on December 31, 2015.\n(2)\nOptions expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nThe total grant date fair value of stock options vested during 2013, 2014 and 2015 was $223 million, $94 million, and $33 million. The aggregate intrinsic value of all options and warrants exercised during 2013, 2014 and 2015 was $1,793 million, $589 million, and $867 million. These amounts do not include the aggregate sales price of options sold under our Transferable Stock Options (TSO) program, which was discontinued as of November 29, 2013.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there was $12 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding employee stock options. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.6 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation expense related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nThe following table summarizes the activities for our unvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2015:\n(1)\nRSUs expected to vest reflect an estimated forfeiture rate.\nAs of December 31, 2015, there was $11.1 billion of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs. This amount is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.7 years. To the extent the actual forfeiture rate is different from what we have estimated, stock-based compensation expense related to these awards will be different from our expectations.\nShare Repurchases\nIn October 2015, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $5,099,019,513.59 of its Class C capital stock, commencing in the fourth quarter of 2015. The repurchases are being executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\npurchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through the use of 10b5-1 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2015, we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 2,391 thousand shares of Alphabet Class C capital stock for an aggregate amount of approximately $1,780 million. Alphabet's share repurchases in the year ended December 31, 2015 were funded by Google via a return of capital to Alphabet.\nIn January 2016, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase an additional amount of approximately 514 thousand shares.\nGoogle Stockholders' Equity\nAs a result of the Alphabet reorganization, Google has recorded various intercompany activities during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2015 as capital transactions, which are reflected in Google's Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. Refer to Stock-Based Compensation and Share Repurchases section above, and Note 6, for descriptions of certain activities. Additionally, subsequent to the reorganization, shares withheld to satisfy employee withholding tax obligations and cash received from the exercise of stock options were recorded as capital transactions between Alphabet and Google and are reflected as such in Google's Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.\nNote 14. 401(k) Plans\nWe have two 401(k) Savings Plans (401(k) Plans) that qualify as deferred salary arrangements under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these 401(k) Plans, matching contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’ contributions subject to certain limitations. We contributed approximately $202 million, $259 million, and $309 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015.\nNote 15. Income Taxes\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes included income from domestic operations of $7,651 million, $8,894 million, and $8,271 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015, and income from foreign operations of $8,248 million, $8,365 million, and $11,380 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015.\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following (in millions):\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe reconciliation of federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows (in millions):\nA retroactive and permanent reinstatement of the federal research credit was signed into law on December 18, 2015 in accordance with the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015. As such, our effective tax rate for 2015 reflects the benefit of the 2015 federal research and development tax credit.\nA retroactive extension of the 2012 federal research and development credit was signed into law on January 2, 2013 in accordance with The American Taxpayer Act of 2012. The benefit of $189 million related to the 2012 federal research and development credit is included in the year ended December 31, 2013.\nOur effective tax rate for 2015 included a discrete tax benefit related to refunds and reductions in uncertain tax positions due to the resolution of a multi-year tax audit in the U.S.\nOur effective tax rate is impacted by earnings realized in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the federal statutory tax rate. Substantially all of the income from foreign operations was earned by an Irish subsidiary.\nWe have not provided U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 because we intend to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the U.S. If these foreign earnings were to be repatriated in the future, the related U.S. tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income taxes previously paid on these earnings. As of December 31, 2015, the cumulative amount of earnings upon which U.S. income taxes have not been provided is approximately $58.3 billion. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.\nOn July 27, 2015, the United States Tax Court, in an opinion in Altera Corp. v. Commissioner, invalidated the portion of the Treasury regulations issued under IRC Section 482 requiring related-party participants in a cost sharing arrangement to share stock-based compensation costs. The U.S. Tax Court issued the final decision on December 28, 2015. The government has 90 days from the final decision date to file a notice of appeal. At this time, the U.S. Treasury has not withdrawn the requirement to include stock-based compensation from its regulations. We have evaluated the opinion and have recorded a tax benefit of $3.5 billion related to reimbursement of cost share payments for the previously shared stock-based compensation costs. In addition, we have recorded a tax liability of $3.5 billion for the U.S. tax cost of potential repatriation of the associated contingent foreign earnings because at this time we cannot reasonably conclude that the Company has the ability and the intent to indefinitely reinvest these contingent earnings. The net impact to our consolidated financial statements is not material. We will continue to monitor developments related to the case and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in millions):\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $482 million and $443 million. If not utilized, the federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2021 and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2016. The net operating loss carryforwards are subject to various annual limitations under the tax laws of the different jurisdictions. Our foreign net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were $263 million that can be carried over indefinitely.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our California research and development credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $1,044 million that can be carried over indefinitely. We believe the state tax credit is not likely to be realized. Our foreign tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $223 million that will start to expire in 2025. We believe it is more likely than not that all of the foreign tax credit will be realized.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we maintained a valuation allowance with respect to certain of our deferred tax assets relating primarily to investment losses that are capital in nature, California deferred tax assets, and certain foreign net operating losses that we believe are not likely to be realized. We established a deferred tax asset for the book-to-tax basis difference in our investments in Arris shares received from the sale of the Motorola Home business to Arris in 2013. Since any future losses to be recognized upon the sale of Arris shares will be capital losses, a valuation allowance has been recorded against this deferred tax asset to the extent such deferred tax asset is not covered by capital gains generated as of 2015. We reassess the valuation allowance quarterly and if future evidence allows for a partial or full release of the valuation allowance, a tax benefit will be recorded accordingly.\nAs a result of the Altera opinion, we have recorded a deferred tax asset of $3.5 billion and a deferred tax liability of $3.5 billion. Refer to above for more details on the Altera case.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2015 (in millions):\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $2,502 million, $3,294 million, and $4,167 million as of December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively, of which, $2,309 million, $2,909 million, and $3,614 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.\nAs of December 31, 2014 and 2015, we had accrued $239 million and $348 million in interest and penalties in provision for income taxes.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions, our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS completed its examination of our 2003 through 2006 tax years; all issues have been settled except for one which we have filed an appeal with the IRS and plan to litigate in court. The IRS is currently in examination of our 2007 through 2012 tax years. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented.\nOur 2013, 2014, and 2015 tax years remain subject to examination by the IRS for U.S. federal tax purposes, and our 2011 through 2015 tax years remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the impact, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in our tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.\nNote 16. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\nIn conjunction with the Alphabet reorganization, in the fourth quarter of 2015, we implemented legal and operational changes in how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) manages our businesses, including resource allocation and performance assessment. Consequently, we have multiple operating segments, representing the individual businesses run separately under the Alphabet structure.\nGoogle is our only reportable segment. None of our other segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the operating segments are combined and disclosed below as Other Bets. All prior-period amounts have been adjusted retrospectively to reflect the reportable segment change.\nOur reported segments are described below:\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\n•\nGoogle - Google includes our main internet products such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome, Google Play as well as hardware products we sell, such as Chromecast, Chromebooks and Nexus. Our technical infrastructure and newer efforts like Virtual Reality are also included in Google. Google generates revenues primarily from advertising, sales of digital content, apps and cloud services, as well as sales of Google branded hardware.\n•\nOther Bets - Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Other Bets includes businesses such as Access/Google Fiber, Calico, Nest, Verily, GV, Google Capital, X, and other initiatives. Revenues from the Other Bets is derived primarily through the sales of Nest hardware products, internet and TV services through Google Fiber and licensing and R&D services through Verily.\nRevenue, cost of revenue, and operating expenses are generally directly attributed to our segments. Inter-segment revenues are not presented separately, as these amounts are immaterial. Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information.\nInformation about segments during the periods presented were as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nReconciling items are primarily related to corporate administrative costs and other miscellaneous items that are not allocated to individual segments.\n(2)\nReconciling items are primarily related to timing differences of payments as segment capital expenditures are on accrual basis while total capital expenditures shown on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow are on cash basis, capital expenditures of Motorola Mobile and Home, and other miscellaneous differences.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nStock-based compensation and depreciation, amortization and impairment are included in segment operating income (loss) as below (in millions):\n(3)\nReconciling items represent corporate administrative costs that are not allocated to individual segments.\n(4)\nFor purposes of segment reporting, we define SBC as awards accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 718 that we expect to settle in stock. SBC does not include expenses related to awards that we will ultimately settle in cash. Amounts exclude SBC from discontinued operations.\n(5)\nReconciling items primarily represent depreciation, amortization and impairment related to Motorola Mobile and Motorola Home.\nRevenues by geography are based on the billing addresses of our customers. The following tables set forth revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area (in millions):\nNote 17. Revision of Previously Issued Financial Statements\nIn the second quarter of 2015, we identified an incorrect classification of certain revenues between legal entities, and as a consequence, we revised our income tax expense for periods beginning in 2008 through the first quarter of 2015 in the cumulative amount of $711 million. We have evaluated the materiality of the income tax expense impact quantitatively and qualitatively and concluded it was not material to any of the prior periods impacted and that correction of income tax expense as an out of period adjustment in the quarter ended June 30, 2015 is not material to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. Consolidated revenues are not impacted. We elected to revise previously issued consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the periods impacted to correct the effect of this immaterial income tax expense underaccrual for the corresponding periods.\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe following table presents the impact of these corrections on affected Consolidated Balance Sheet line items as of December 31, 2014 (in millions):\n(1) Includes reclassifications of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to ASU 2015-17 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.” Refer to Note 1 for further information.\nThe following table presents the impact of these corrections on affected Consolidated Statements of Income line items, including net income per share amounts for Class A and B common stock and Class C capital stock, for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 (in millions, except per share amounts):\nThe following table presents the impact of these corrections on affected Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income line items for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 (in millions):\nAlphabet Inc. and Google Inc.\nThe following table presents the impact of these corrections on affected Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows line items for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 (in millions):",
